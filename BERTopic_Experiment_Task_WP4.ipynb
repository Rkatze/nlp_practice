For two terms in the House, she was a reference on this subject, but, beyond the political sensitivity that led her to work to support culture and make it accessible to everyone, Emilia really understood culture, music and theatre: she had so much to teach about this and this sensitivity gave her the opportunity to cultivate so many relationships and to get in touch with worlds often far from politics.

In this branch of Parliament Emilia then worked for an entire term as President of the Health Committee: she did so while important and controversial issues were being discussed.

For some years she attended the Municipality of Gaby in the Gressoney valley and on those occasions I had the pleasure of accompanying her to visit the socio-health facilities of my Region, always showing her great attention to the provision of services in the territories, and to host her also on the occasion of conferences in which she participated with competence and passion. I remember that, when we met here in the Senate, she greeted me with a  Bonjour, monsieur le sénateur , as I am called in my country, with a rotating R that made the French impeccable. I would like to mention briefly how important your political work and your role as President of the Health Committee were in enabling the adoption of important laws such as the one on the reorganisation of the health professions, the one containing provisions on the safety of health care for citizens and on the professional responsibility of health professionals.

I am referring to definitely different experiences; when I met Emilia I was first a militant and then a young party leader, while Emilia had already accumulated a long political experience, on the territory and also at the national level. But she was crossed by the awareness that one of the functions of political communities and parties should be to identify and select the ruling class and to make it grow, in a relationship between generations that had to be frank and dialectical. I say this with a smile, because those who know Emilia know what it means to have a dialectical relationship with her (using a euphemism, of course). This relationship was always centered on the awareness that the ruling classes do not fall from the sky, but are the result of a patient and constant construction, of a relationship and a confrontation, even between representatives of different generations and different paths. I owe a lot to Emilia also from this point of view. She thought that there were no battles for women, battles for LGBT rights, battles for childhood, battles for fragility, but that each battle lived on the strength of battles for others and that strengthening the rights of each meant strengthening the rights of all others. This was her thought, this was her conviction and I believe that the debt we owe to a personality, with a figure like Emilia is exactly this: to understand, in the new world we are entering, the importance of this kind of reflection, which she naturally made live in the exercise of her parliamentary function and in her political initiative. She did so as President of the Commission for Health and Hygiene, but she did so in general in her struggles, so we will miss her thinking, her initiative, her expertise in this very difficult time we are going through. We will also miss that smile and that overwhelming laughter that was noticeable every time we confronted her and that was the conclusion of any confrontation, even the harshest. Thank you Emilia, we will miss you very much.\\n',\n",

These are the four words that I have in my heart and that she defended without fear in front of anyone.

A very thorough knowledge survey was carried out on the sustainability of the health system. The results of this paper are still very relevant today - indeed, especially today.

I had the opportunity and the honour of being with her in the 16th Parliament in the 7th Commission, so that I could grasp all the aspects of her personality: the aspect of a Member who went into detail about every measure, as well as her polemical vis. I remember, in moments of great tension, her sharp words, which I think are unforgettable for everyone. She was incredible and did not give up because she always had to bring the comparison of ideas to the end. I remember her attitude always very serious and responsible and the love that shone even from the treatment of the various measures; a great love for culture in any form, be it music, books, publishing or her blog on rock. She was truly multifaceted, with an extraordinary enthusiasm and a desire to live every moment with great intensity. I think her characteristic was exactly this: her enthusiasm for life and her work and her desire to also participate in the battles for gender equality and against violence against women, which I assure you were not so easy then as they are today. We also had a lot of discussions on this subject. On other matters we had very different views, but we never lacked respect and esteem. As we all know, in the end you live more with your colleagues in the Commission than with your family. It was a constructive relationship because, as has already been said, Emilia also liked to compare and there was always a way of communicating and learning from each other, an attitude - this - which I really like and try to practice every day. On behalf of the League-Salvini Premier-Sardinian Action Party Group, I would therefore like to offer my condolences to the family and colleagues and friends of the Democratic Party Group, who with Emilia lose not only a friend, but a fundamental component, for how she wanted to live her political passion, 100 percent, but also all the other aspects of life.\\n\",\n",

First a member of the PCI, to which she gave her contribution, for its transformation and for the construction of the PDS and then, gradually, up to the founding manifesto of the PD. She was a municipal councillor in Milan for the PDS, twice deputy, in the XV and XVI legislature and then senator in the XVII legislature. She said: Women, culture, information and work are the four words that are close to my heart and in fact her action has always been directed at the defence of women, their rights, gender equality in every sphere, whether in the family, at work, in society and in political life. In the cultural sphere, her contribution has been tangible, as demonstrated by the approval of the law on live entertainment, but also the law on fair remuneration for freelance journalists, the reform of publishing, tax relief measures for cinema and the recognition of unemployment benefits for artists. As her colleagues recalled, she was Chair of the Senate's Hygiene and Health Commission in the last legislature and in this field she has also made a tangible and concrete contribution, working to achieve important progress on civilization and respect for the dignity of patients. I am referring in particular to advance treatment arrangements, an issue which in Italy is always particularly sensitive, to informed consent and to the responsibility of healthcare professionals. She has also committed herself to the approval of the reform of the health professions, to the strengthening and modernisation of the National Health Service, to ensuring its universality and fairness, especially towards the most vulnerable groups. It can be said with certainty that she has always worked for the enhancement of what we might call the human capital of our National Health Service and to promote dialogue and discussion between institutions and organisations of citizens and patients. It is precisely because of her unwavering commitment to health that she received, in 2016, from the GIMBE Foundation, the award entitled Let's save our national health service. Some choices have divided us, as is normal and as happens in politics, but I can say with confidence that, with the death of Emilia De Biasi, we lose a woman who dedicated her life to others and politics, always attentive to the needs of citizens and to respect and strengthening the republican institutions.\\n\",\n",

The Convention on the Elimination of Violence and Harassment in the World of Work, adopted last June on the occasion of the centenary of the creation of the International Labour Organisation (ILO), is rightly described as a landmark ruling because it represents a concrete step forward. First of all, it provides a broad definition of violence and harassment: a definition that includes not only physical but also verbal abuse, as well as phenomena such as stalking and mobbing, because it explicitly refers to gender-based violence and harassment that can cause physical, psychological, sexual but also economic harm. It also covers volunteers, people in training, traineeships and apprenticeships, and even those who are looking for work or workers whose relationship has been terminated. Another positive aspect is that violence or harassment is also recognised when it occurs outside the workplace, in the physical sense, and therefore includes all behaviour that occurs, for example, during business trips and social events, as well as in the context of communications that take place via telematics. This is particularly important in view of the increase in sexual harassment on new social networks such as WhatsApp, which are less formal but equally insidious. The Convention also provides for a wide range of obligations for States and, subsequently, for employers, who are no longer only able but also obliged to guarantee the protection of all those involved in the workplace. By ratifying this Convention, we are, in essence, promoting a reversal of the cultural approach and of the collective approach to the phenomenon. Among other things, obligations are foreseen for the various States, including the introduction of decisive powers for labour inspectors and other supervisory authorities. Today, it is estimated that 80 per cent of women who experience abuse at work or by their managers often do not report or talk about it just to live quietly or for fear of scandal or retaliation. However, this violence often affects those who are most vulnerable in the world of work. It is a change, a turning point. It is a question of promoting a cultural revolution which makes possible a change of pace. This is also why it is important today to ratify this Convention. I hope that the vote will bring together the different political forces, unlike what happened in the Commission, because one cannot speak of interference with national law. When it comes to protecting the dignity of workers, there must be no justification or excuse because the only interference is that which treats the body of others as if it were an object of their own property, at work and outside.\\n',\n",

Another consideration: the Convention calls for violence and harassment in the workplace, but it also involves and seeks to address a complex array of issues, as has already been mentioned. I am referring to mobbing, stalking, psychological violence, the issue of worker protection and how to prevent and deal with violence and harassment. There is also a further step: a broad interpretation is meant precisely because it looks at a set of behaviours, practices and acts intended to cause or even threaten physical, psychological and economic harm, or which is intended to be a sexual offence or gender-based violence. There is also a further step: it is a broad interpretation precisely because it looks at a set of behaviours, practices and acts intended to cause or even threaten physical, psychological and economic harm, or which are - it is envisaged - configured as a sexual offence or as gender-based violence. Another forward-looking element of the Convention is that it is addressed to all types of workers, i.e. not only to employees, and not only to workplaces - I want to emphasize this - but also to those that I allow myself to define as not only places, which are nevertheless only connected to the world of work, i.e. for example, work trips, job training courses away from the usual workplace, but also the means of communication and information, chats, e-mails and WhatsApp, that is, all those offensive messages, which we know can be used in an invasive way, such as text messages, images and even threatening messages, as well as text messages and messages, which can be used in an aggressive way, as we well know, as text messages and even threatening messages. Another forward-looking element of the Convention is that it is addressed to all types of workers, that is to say not only to employees, and not only to workplaces - I would like to emphasize this - but also to those which I may call non-places, but which are nevertheless linked to the world of work, i.e. for example, business trips, vocational training courses away from the usual place of work, but also to the means of communication and information such as chats, text messages, e-mails, WhatsApp messages, i.e. all those tools which, as we know, can be used in an invasive, pervasive and I would even say distorting way, becoming aggressive, offensive and threatening through the transmission of video, images or text. This is why the Convention makes an effort to include them. Before concluding, I want to go back to the statistical evidence from which I started, referring to the only survey we have practically, however dated. Before concluding, I would like to return to the statistical evidence from which I started, referring to the only survey we have practically, however dated. I am referring to the 2016 Istat survey on the safety of citizens, which also addresses the chapter on violence and harassment at work and sexual blackmail. One of the statistics provided by Istat is that 1.404 million women have experienced physical harassment and sexual harassment at work in their lifetime, or 8.9 percent of the female workforce. The survey also found that over 425,000 women, or 2.7 percent, experienced these episodes in the three-year period 2013-2016. It is clear that the figures are quite different when we talk about violence outside the workplace (those I mentioned are confined to the workplace). It is clear that the figures are quite different when we talk about violence outside the workplace (those I mentioned are confined to the workplace). Cases involve physical contact, requests for sexual services or availability in exchange for a promotion or job or promotion, promotion or threat of dismissal. The Institute notes that in over 80% of cases victims do not report or tell anyone what happened to them: only 0.7% of victims do. The same Institute notes that in more than 80 per cent of cases victims do not report or tell anyone what happened to them: only 0.7 per cent of victims do. Of course, all the victims interviewed by the Istat stress that these incidents have changed their lives, both personally and professionally, because many of them have been fired or have resigned, or have not been hired or have been dismissed. Surely, however, all the victims interviewed by the Istat point out that these incidents have changed their lives, both personal and professional, because many of them have been fired or have resigned, or have not been hired or have been dismissed.

              " \"DE PETRIS (Misto-LeU). - (FR) Mr President, I believe that today is a very important day and frankly I regret that the House is rather distracted in discussing the ratification of this very important convention. It is a solemn undertaking that our country is taking on at this moment and is finally going to approve and ratify the Convention itself. Compared to other conventions, we have succeeded in getting it approved fairly quickly, since in this Chamber we are used to ratifying treaties signed many years before. Above all, we have to deal - this is the really important part of this ratification - with the data that my colleague before me was reminding us of. The European Union Agency's survey on violence against women says that one in two women say they have experienced some form of sexual harassment at work. In 32 per cent of cases the harasser is a colleague, a subordinate or a superior, and these figures are dramatic. Even more dramatic are the data of the 2016 Istat survey, which shows that in Italy there are 1,400,000 women affected by forms of harassment, violence, blackmail and other forms of sexual blackmail. When women are interviewed, when they are selected, the first thing they are asked is whether they intend to have children. This is the other element of deep discrimination. This occurs at the time of recruitment, but also during the career, with all that goes with it. 32.4% of these blackmailings are repeated daily; 17.4% about once a week; 29.4% sometimes a month and 19.2% more rarely. If we then read these figures on the basis of the fact that in our country we have a very high female employment deficit (18% less than male employment, which unfortunately, as we know, is what it is these days), we are faced with a really dramatic figure. Eighty-one per cent of the victims interviewed never spoke about it and less than one per cent then had the courage to report what had happened or managed to find some form of socialization. That is why I say that ratifying the Convention in question today is of fundamental importance, because thanks to it we have at our disposal a real tool in the fight against violence and harassment committed in the world of work, we are doing a fundamental act to support women and anyone who is subjected to this kind of blackmail in the workplace and above all to give them the possibility and the force of respect for their dignity. Let us think about the figures I told you about earlier, about how many women are forced to change jobs and quit or have been fired. The scope is precisely the protection of workers, irrespective of their contractual status, in a world of work which is so fragmented and changing, and in which there are now so many different forms of work. This includes volunteers, trainees, trainees, apprentices and jobseekers: there is therefore a very wide range of protection. The Convention provides for a wide range of protection and prevention measures, with obligations on States, and therefore on our State, to adopt all internal provisions defining violence and harassment and all measures to prevent these harmful behaviours, including from a compensatory and repressive point of view. This means that it requires States to ensure that potential victims have effective access to justice, by preparing measures to remedy them. The Convention devotes particular attention to gender-based violence and above all seeks to do political and cultural advocacy and training work; this is the other fundamental element. Today we are about to approve - I am sure, unanimously - a very important ratification, a very important ratification. Of course, we all hope - because I think we all agree on this - that we will be able to make the best use of this instrument, including the obligation it imposes on the State to adopt all the acts and legislative provisions which make it possible to extend the system of protection and, above all, to prevent.\\n\",\n",

              " \"ROSSOMANDO (PD). - (PT) Mr President, ladies and gentlemen of the Government, ladies and gentlemen, in our country 9 per cent of women have been physically harassed or sexually blackmailed while at work. If a woman is sexually blackmailed, 80 percent of the time she does not tell anyone at work; almost no one reports it, yet at least 70 percent of women who have been sexually blackmailed find it very or fairly serious.33 percent of these women have voluntarily changed jobs or quit their careers because of sexual harassment at work; 10 percent have been fired or put into a reintegration box. This is the framework under which the International Labour Organisation adopted, on 21 June 2019, the Convention on the Elimination of Violence and Harassment in the Workplace, with an overwhelming majority of Member States. Work is the place of people's rights and emancipation and I am proud that Italy will be the first of 187 Member States to ratify this Convention. Italy is a country that already has anti-discrimination and worker protection rules, but today we are approving a framework and a very innovative protection programme. I would like to emphasise the international nature of this regulatory framework. We are now accustomed to associating the word globalisation with the loss of rights and the deterioration of working conditions. We want to reverse this equation and for there to be a globalisation of rights against the exploitation of people, a globalisation no longer driven by the unregulated market and outside the cooperation of States, which too often has led to a loss of dignity for people and caused social tensions and mistrust in citizenship relations. It is therefore time for the globalisation of the rights and dignity of the person, with his freedoms and the right to freely choose his own living conditions and future. Violence and harassment in the workplace are violations of human rights and this type of violence, which translates into physical, verbal and blackmailing harassment, is unfortunately still covered by silence, silence and lack of solidarity, much more than in other cases of violence - already reprehensible. As I said, almost 90 percent of women who suffered did not report it. First of all, an expansion of the definition of violence or harassment, but above all of the place: the place of work is not only the physical place of the establishment, but it can also be the home or a place of travel and - attention - in the Covid era, at a time when there is a lot of teleworking, in which smart working is used, there has been an increase in violence both in domestic locations and through computer means, so this is very important. There is an obligation of the Member States to prescribe and the employer to adopt preventive and repressive measures and there is an obligation to guarantee access to justice, as well as a greater involvement of labour inspectors. Our country, in fact, as has been said, does not go unnoticed on this issue. I would like to recall two issues for everyone: in the 2018 budget law we introduced the prohibition on dismissal, dismissal and transfer following a complaint of sexual harassment, as well as the nullity of retaliatory dismissal or the dismissal of the complainant, in addition - of course - to the prohibition on blank dismissal. The main cause, however, lies in the power imbalance between perpetrators and victims of violence. I would like to recall the words of Guy Ryder, Director-General of the ILO, when he says that these rights must be put into practice in order to create a better, safer and more dignified working environment for women and men. We talk a lot about investment and work at this difficult time for our country, for all European democracies and worldwide. Investing in work and its quality also means investing in its dignity, which is a very important factor of social cohesion, belonging and redemption of people, because it marks the relationship between the person and the community and it is also and above all from this that being citizens and not subjects passes. For these reasons, the vote of the Democratic Party will obviously be in favour of the ratification in question, but it will above all be a vote of convinced and firm commitment to legislate on these issues and fully implement the Constitution.\\n\",\n",

Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, the measure in question concerns the authorisation to ratify and implement the Convention adopted by the International Labour Organisation on 21 June 2019 with the aim of eliminating violence and harassment in the world of work. The importance of the issue of work is the focus of our political activity. A healthy country is a country that works and, therefore, any attention that can improve the protection of workers in its work environment is an objective to be pursued. The text provides for a comprehensive framework of obligations for Member States, ranging from the adoption of internal provisions defining violence and harassment in accordance with the Convention and requiring employers to take all measures to prevent harmful behaviour, to the more general obligation for States themselves to take the necessary measures, both preventive and punitive. The Convention will then be subject to the monitoring mechanism provided for by the International Labour Organisation, first through periodic reports submitted by States. I therefore wonder, colleagues, whether there is no risk of opening up a new arena of conflict between States, based on judicial struggles, which instead conceal a real desire to attack, at the international level, an unwelcome country or government. It is also necessary to consider the power of complaint which is granted to the Board of Directors of the same Organization and even to individual delegates to the International Labour Conference, making it possible to initiate, on their own initiative, a procedure capable of leading to the creation of a Commission of Inquiry, charged with drawing up a report containing, if necessary, recommendations for the State concerned. Mr President, in conclusion, there are therefore some points of perplexity, which I wanted to express and share with colleagues. As I have already said, we are not opposed to the principles that the Convention promotes, but we have doubts about their translation into practice. Despite these points of uncertainty, given the shared objectives of this Convention, I vote in favour of the League-Salvini Premier Group-Sardinian Action Party.\\n\",\n",

This impact is staggering to say the least. Sexual harassment, violence and blackmail in the workplace: how many women are victims?It is even difficult to estimate, because there is no specific type of crime and there has never been regular and constant monitoring of this type of violence. To get an idea of this, we have to go back to the only existing Istat survey, which dates back to 2016. The figures are worrying: in fact, 1.404 million women have been physically harassed or sexually blackmailed at work during their working lives. This is one in ten women. On the other hand, 1.173 million, or 7.5%, women have been subjected to some form of sexual blackmail in the course of their working lives in order to get a job, keep a job or advance in their career. Not to mention complaints: only 0.7 per cent of victims of blackmail have reported them to law enforcement. Why, in the face of such a widespread phenomenon, are there so few complaints?For rather obvious reasons: fear of not being believed or even blamed, of losing their job or of all being in vain. Can we blame them?I would say no. Just think of the shocking case last summer when the president of the Lucan transport company, Cotrab, despite being tried and sentenced to two years and six months for sexual violence against an employee, was re-elected by the same consortium. This woman was one of the 0.7 percent of victims who found the courage to report, defied the fear of losing their jobs and not being believed, and faced a lengthy trial. The culprit is convicted, but then everything risks being thwarted by a subculture that normalizes and trivializes sexual violence at work. The episode shows that the current tools are not enough to counter this hateful phenomenon. I feel that I agree with the concern expressed, among others, by the Foundation for the Study of Labour Consultants, which highlights how the devastating effects of the COVID-19 pandemic on women's employment, such as increased job insecurity and the resulting economic and social disadvantage, can contribute to further exacerbating the phenomenon of harassment and especially blackmail in the workplace. I recall that already in 2019, the Commission on Femicide - of which I am honoured to be a member - had dedicated November 25 of that year to combating violence and harassment in the workplace, highlighting how work is a universally recognised right and, nevertheless, work itself still represents a place of inequality between men and women. We therefore welcome the achievement of today's ratification of the ILO Convention, which recognises that violence and harassment constitute a violation or abuse of human rights and recognises the right of everyone to a world of work free from violence and harassment. I would also like to emphasise that the Armed Forces are also a workplace. Women have been part of the Armed Forces for 21 years now, so it is no longer possible to postpone the introduction of the specific offences of violence and sexual harassment, even within the military penal code.\\n\",\n",

In particular, we are voting against it because we are not convinced by Article 1, which - as Senator Alfieri has pointed out - adds a further period to the preamble to the Convention; to be more precise, it adds a new recital.

What is new in the 'considered' and which we do not like is the following, namely the prediction - perhaps not all of you have read it - for which the national courts must act:] under the supervision of the European Court of Human Rights [...]. We are voting on a principle which overturns all the Italian constitutional jurisprudence that has been passed up to now.

He was the extreme offspring in Sicily of the Enlightenment; a restless investigator and above all attentive to the recovery of the context, as his favorite author, Alessandro Manzoni, taught him. He had the confidence of the Enlightenment intellectual, the analysis conducted in his own way with a bitter irony; an intention that he knew how to decline in a thousand variations in his works and articles and always aimed at the useful. He was an intellectual of whom today one feels a deep lack and need, far from conformity and from any compromise, as well as scevro from any courtiership.

Talking about the Mafia at a time when its existence was denied and its transformative and mimetic capacity within society was truly an extraordinary insight, considering the time when it was published The Day of the Owl, in 1961. And a few years after that, in 1963, the Anti-Mafia Commission was set up. He spoke of anti-mafia in the late eighties, just when anti-mafia was rising all over Italy. I refer to an article published in Corriere della sera on 10 January 1987, devoted to the relationship between politics, popularity and anti-mafia, in which he explained how anti-mafia can become a formidable tool to make a career, obtain the consent of the public and acquire credits.

From this Sciascia also makes a kind of archaeology, starting from far and precisely from the work of the prefect Mori, sent to Sicily by the fascist Government to solve the issue by military hand, which earned him the advancement of his career. He then came to his days, revealing the danger inherent in the anti-mafia, of which the most serious is to resort to it to have extraordinary powers and momentary suspension of the State of law. For Sciascia the real challenge was to defeat the mafia with ordinary tools, without indulging in authoritarian drift or delusions of omnipotence.

              " 'BOLDRINI (PD). - (IT) Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I should like to draw your attention to an incident of national importance which took place last Thursday in my constituency of Ferrara. Beyond the confidence due to the work of the police, who are investigating to understand whether it is the isolated action of an individual or if it falls into a more complex picture, I think we can not but express not only indignation, but also concern. The letter to the MEIS, even if it was sent by a fool, therefore has a precise meaning; the destination is not random, but precise, as are the offences contained. It must be said that in Ferrara there is a historic Jewish community, perfectly integrated, with which there is a deep, intense and continuous dialogue at all institutional levels. Ferrara is the city where our senator Liliana Segre came, on January 11, 2019, enchanting an audience of 700 students in a crowded theater, telling her experience of surviving Auschwitz. And it is the city where the administration, today led by a legist, wanted to grant her in the same year honorary citizenship, for the deep bond, woven in time. Ferrara is the city of Bassani, the Finzi Contini and the city of MEIS. The letter was sent in the run-up to Remembrance Day, 27 January, a commemoration of the Holocaust victims, in memory of the opening of the gates of Auschwitz on 27 January 1945. Other events have occurred elsewhere: last Sunday the presentation, via Zoom, of the book The Desert Generation by the Roman author Lia Tagliacozzo, an event promoted by the Jewish Studies Center in Turin, was interrupted. Images of Hitler were introduced, insults such as Jews in the ovens, We will burn you all, and I stop here. It is therefore a scientifically organised attack, using new digital tools. It is difficult to think of a coincidence, especially at a time when neo-Nazi impulses are awakening everywhere in Europe. We are witnessing a resurgence of hatred, typical of times of social unrest and unrest, when ideologies take root more easily, because they sink and cement themselves in the dissatisfaction and frustration of people, who are presented with an enemy to encourage their struggle against each other. If Jews have always been - as I said just now - easy targets, the pandemic crisis we are experiencing is fertile ground for cultivating and instilling further fears. I therefore ask for the commitment of all those present to monitor, guard and distance themselves from such incidents, which cannot be robbed as minor, just because they do not have devastating effects, because they are not: among the effects is the risk of emulation they generate. Trust in the police must be accompanied by a constant awareness campaign. I conclude my speech by recalling, duly, the words of the president of the MEIS and the director: The ignominious and cowardly act only increases the determination and tenacity with which the museum leads and will lead the mission assigned to it by the Italian Parliament to keep the memory alive, to fight anti-Semitism and to educate the new generations to the principles of equality and fraternity that our Constitution calls us to pursue.\\n',\n",

National legislation provides for this as a last resort waste, but in other European countries the waste from petroleum processing is kept to a minimum, as it is used as a fuel, for its high energy value. I therefore hope that the same solution can be found in Italy by making landfills useless or reducing their volume. In Verona, a request was submitted to the Veneto Region for the construction of a landfill in Sorgà, De Morta, occupying a total area of 455,000 square metres. The waste will come for 65 percent from a company in Castelnuovo del Garda and for 35 percent from a company in Lainate.

This week we see a general deterioration in the epidemiological situation in the country: RT, incidence, occupancy rate of intensive care units and outbreaks of unknown origin are increasing at the same time. To be even more precise, I report, albeit in a schematic way, the main data emerged from the last monitoring booth. Let's start with the RT: in the period between December 15 and 28, 2020, after four weeks, the RT rises again and for the first time, after six weeks, it is now above index 1. Even this data, taken individually, clearly indicates that we are very likely at a new phase change: the epidemic is again in an expansive phase. The data tell us that the RT calculated on symptomatic cases is 1.03; 3 regions have a point RT greater than 1 even in the lower value; 6 regions exceed it in the average value; one region reaches it and 3 touch it.

In the last 14 days, we went from 305.47 new cases per 100,000 inhabitants between December 14 and 27 to 313.28 cases in the period from December 21 to January 3. Although the week under assessment was characterised by a lower number of tampons on public holidays, there is again an increase in incidence, which in the country now stands at 166.02 per 100. Although the week under assessment was characterized by a lower number of tampons on public holidays, there is again an increase in incidence, which in the country is now equal to 166.02 per 100,000 inhabitants in a week. As the monitoring booth report shows, the countrywide incidence is therefore still far from levels that would allow case identification and contact tracing to be fully restored throughout the country. As noted in the monitoring cabin report, the incidence across the territory is therefore still far from levels that would allow the full restoration of case identification and contact tracing across the national territory.

With a weekly incidence value of 166, we are 3 times higher than the ceiling of 50 new cases, considered the maximum threshold that can be managed by regional health services. No wonder, then, that the number of new cases not linked to known transmission chains is rising sharply from 31,825 to 40.825 to 40,487.487. The other automatic effect of the increase in the incidence rate is the progressive overload of hospital facilities.

              " \"Mr. President, Mr. Minister, honourable colleagues, the virus continues to spread rapidly; the emergence of new variants with greater dissemination capacity, even if with unchanged pathogenic action, has simply accelerated this process. We see this simply by observing what happens in other European countries, which in fact alternate measures and phases that are less restrictive with others that push up to total lockdown. Our country, which also experiences the difficulties of regionalization of the national health system as a result of the rules of Title V of the Constitution, in the path of the fight against coronavirus, despite the enormous difficulties involved, has always tried to maintain the right balance between restrictions and concessions, between openings and closings, despite the large problems and repercussions that each measure brought with it. We must never forget, however, a fundamental point that so many citizens demand: the protection of health comes first. The protection of the integrity and life of everyone goes beyond what may be the demands, even just and justified, of some. No one has ever forgotten, in the various measures adopted, the economic, social and complex problematic consequences for so many citizens that they would cause, but always trying to give concrete answers. The political will has always been to protect the most disadvantaged economic groups and the most fragile and vulnerable people in our social state. Unfortunately, a greater elasticity and a reduction in the most restrictive measures is almost a logical consequence of a rapid increase in infections, an acceleration in the spread of the virus and its surge with the rise of the RT index. Increasingly, it is necessary to insist on the continuous awareness and information of citizens, in recalling their sense of citizenship and belonging to the community. If we do not all succeed in this process of maturation and inner processing, we will not be able to eradicate or defeat the virus. Any measure, even the most shared and participated, requires the convinced adherence of every citizen. It's an adherence that for the most part has been and for which we can only thank the Italians. It's important to remember that the rules apply and are fully realized only if each of us understands that, in this pandemic, everyone has to do their part every day, not out of simple obligation or fear of sanctions, but because our responsible behaviour is an indispensable condition in the difficult battle against the coronavirus. Those who govern must know how to sparkle and balance the measures with the right balances. If the virus is so dynamic and changeable in its aggressiveness, even the consequential policy choices cannot be static, but must be balanced and modified in relation to the trend of the pandemic. I would like to highlight two aspects in particular in the architecture of the DPCM that we are analysing. The first relates to the introduction, in the context of the subdivision of the different zones according to the infectivity index recorded, of the so-called white area, which provides for less restrictive measures than the so-called yellow area, always in order to ensure the maximum consistency between the epidemiological scenario applicable to each territory and the degree of rigor of the containment measures applied. This innovation, agreed with the technical-scientific committee, represents and encompasses, at this particular moment, more than anything else, a symbolic value and a message of encouragement to Italians: be more virtuous and attentive you can and you must. The second aspect concerns the lowering of the threshold value of RT infection rates, to enter or pass through the various areas. Certainly, a fundamental support in the management of this pandemic has begun with the administration of vaccines, whose progressive availability will allow us to have a lethal weapon against the virus, starting with those in the front line, such as health workers, and the weakest and most fragile members of the population. The tens of thousands of deaths, the suffering of intensive care, the gaze lost in the void of those who know that they may not make it are a warning to institutions and citizens, to try to do more and better, in the interest of the community. The many required sacrifices, to which so many have adhered, with awareness and conscience, cannot be undone when, despite the many doubts and uncertainties, at the moment when the vaccination campaign has just begun, we finally step into the light, at the bottom of a tunnel.\\n\",\n",

It is difficult, in fact, for those who do not share them or feel excluded from them, who once again feel neglected, to apply them willingly and feel involved.

Then - as scientists have been telling us for months, since the rapid tampons were developed in June, which are commonplace and can basically be used with very common technical skills, rather than scientific ones - they spread and are found on every street corner, in our cities and in the various squares. There are many volunteers who would like to do this but find bureaucratic obstacles: in the granting of land, in the ASL and even in the identification of doctors who can do this type of activity. In fact, colleagues, not all doctors can do it, although the one to do with rapid tampons is an absolutely banal and simple activity. Lowering the price and making tampons accessible, so that they become a real social habit, through light custody, without large expenses, perhaps also managed by volunteers of the Red Cross or other associations, is important, so that jointly and not disjointly from vaccination allow us to slow down the speed of spread of the virus.

              " 'You, Mr Minister, are well aware that this virus has exacerbated and widened inequalities, hitting the most vulnerable and disadvantaged people the hardest. Hospitals have been overwhelmed by the epidemic wave, despite the extraordinary commitment of the staff, which I want to emphasize. Several screening and oncology visits have been skipped, and many non-Covid diseases cannot be treated; many people who are not self-sufficient have not been able to access therapies; in particular, those with mental disorders and mental frailty could not be followed. So if we have more doctors, more nurses and more ICU beds compared to a year ago and we have put an additional 12 billion in healthcare, we know that we will need more investment. Closing these gaps and getting the most vulnerable people back into the system must be our first priority. You, Mr Minister, have rightly reminded this House that Covid has only a few months and that with vaccines we will defeat the virus. We must not, therefore, misread this decisive phase. Now, in fact, the most complex moment arrives, that of the mass administration: it is a long and complex work, involving all the institutions and requiring maximum collaboration and a widespread information campaign. The country is ready to increase the number of doses to be administered as soon as the new vaccines are authorised. In this sense and in the light of my reference to the need to protect the most vulnerable, I ask you, Mr Minister, to formalize as soon as possible the commitment made by Commissioner Arcuri on priority vaccinations for people with disabilities and their carers. It would be really important to clarify this aspect once and for all. People with disabilities have suffered more than others from the effects of Covid and have often been left alone. Now it is necessary to protect them, as with all other fragile people. I will conclude by dedicating a few more minutes to an issue which is particularly close to my heart and which is one of the commitments we are asking the Government to make: I am talking about schools. It took the pandemic - I say this without any polemical spirit - to put the school at the centre of the public debate?This will perhaps be one of the few positive aspects that the health crisis will leave us. Our country, like many others, has had to deal with a terrible uncertainty, caused by a completely unprecedented situation. In recent days, nations such as Germany and Britain have deemed necessary the painful decision to close all schools of every order and grade. Every country has had to deal with the difficulty of keeping schools open in a situation where the third wave is no longer just a hypothesis. Schools are places where, despite the great prevention work done and the extraordinary commitment - which I want to emphasize - of school administrators, teaching and non-teaching staff and students, you can still get infected. We must continue to work in synergy with the Regions to enable, in the light of the evolution of the epidemiological picture you have indicated with precise data, the return of as many students as possible to the classroom. It is clear, in fact, that this generation is paying dearly for the lack of adequate classrooms and, even more so, the lack of relationships. Further solutions will be needed, in addition to improved transport and flexible schedules. There will have to be a refreshment for this generation that we can call cognitive and emotional. I am not talking about an economic restructuring, but one that is even more important. Investments, initiatives, school activities for recovery, support for what has been taken away from this generation in these long months, strengthening of services and territorial networks, renewal of teaching, as if distance learning could replace teaching in person, and therefore investments in teachers and their training and services aimed at psychophysical well-being. Now we have to work to preserve the ability of students to get out of this season with as little damage as possible, so I hope that we work to strengthen the tools we have, giving priority to pedagogical and psychological support to students, because, in addition to the serious problem of educational debt that is piling up, the problem of economic and social inequalities has intensified, but there is also - and perhaps most importantly - the emotional discomfort of students who are lost, seeking meaning for their present and future days, because, if we fail to build answers, we are risking the future of the country.\\n',\n",

Mr President, representatives of the Government, ladies and gentlemen, Italy is off to a good start on vaccines, but as Minister Speranza pointed out, this is a marathon which is won by perfecting not only the supply machine but also the administration. The feeling is that, since the start of the vaccine campaign, many doubters have changed their minds and that the skepticism that floated in some small segments of public opinion is disappearing. This is why we must continue with the approach you have indicated, that of listening and comparison, avoiding clashes between fans, which would have negative consequences from all angles. We are confidently waiting for 29 January, because if the European medicines agency (EMA) authorises the AstraZeneca vaccine, that day we will really see the light at the end of the tunnel and it seems, as the Minister said, that the request for authorisation by Johnson & Johnson for its vaccine, which has the great advantage of requiring a single dose to guarantee full protection, is also imminent. In the meantime, however, we must continue to manage the situation responsibly and with the prudential approach that has always guided the government's decisions. Of course, there have been times when citizens have found it difficult to understand some decisions, especially when the cards were changed at the last moment, when there was no linearity in communications or when some measures did not seem to meet a proportionality criterion. Despite this, we believe that overall the regional differentiation model has worked and that above all it is adequate to face the phase that awaits us, a phase, that is, when infections do not decrease, there is the unknown of the virus variants, there is the risk that the second wave will be grafted onto the third one immediately, as is happening in other countries. A new wave would jeopardize the vaccination campaign and we absolutely cannot afford this. So the new measures are fine, but only if the restrictions increase and the aid must be increased. Ten months have passed since the first closures, an unsustainable time for most businesses and businesses who are now fighting their battle for survival. So, immediately after the budget displacement, immediately after that white tax year for the self-employed, immediately after compensation to take into account the loss of turnover, immediately after the tax files for small and medium-sized enterprises, which in recent months have not been able to work or have been able to work only to a limited extent. At the same time, Mr Minister, the experience of recent months suggests that certain derogations from specific contexts or situations are necessary and do not in any way represent a danger. This is particularly true in mountainous areas, where the closure of ski lifts is also becoming a problem for the police and hence for the security of the area. Managers should be given the opportunity to open the ski lifts, which without tourism and without travel between the regions would only have the effect of distributing even better the people who climb mountains for motor activities and individual sports and who today, with the ski lifts closed, tend to concentrate in certain areas. It is a matter of making outdoor activities even safer, with people spread over a radius of hundreds of metres, much less dangerous than shopping in a shopping centre or a Saturday afternoon in the streets of the city's shopping centre. Instead, let us treasure what we have learned in these months and what we see every day in our territories, let us promote those individual and collective behaviours that do not pose a risk and that make people's lives less strenuous and above all let us accompany these new measures with an unprecedented commitment to the economy and to the vaccination campaign, which is the most important battle, the one that will lead us out of this tragic experience.\\n\",\n",

              " \"PARENTE (IV-PSI). Mr. President, ladies and gentlemen, the Viva Italia - Socialist Party Group will vote yes to the majority resolution. This is the time of responsibility in the face of the pandemic, but Minister, let this resolution really be a starting point to rebuild healthcare and not navigate by sight as too many times the virus has forced us to do. Health can and should be the highest form of democracy and equality, without any difference in age, gender, territory, health status and income. This is the ideal that is shaped by the National Health Service which you have said many times that you want to defend, and rightly so. But too much inequality and too much falsehood still circulates. Let's think about science. You said it right that science is our beacon. How many falsehoods are still going around about vaccines, that would not be safe because the very short time available to get a vaccine would have jumped the steps?This is not true because the phases have been carried out simultaneously by researchers from all over the world. In the Commission we are carrying out a very important investigation, consulting the leading Italian experts who reassure us on this point. Mr Minister, we must implement transparent institutional and policy information and ensure continuous updating to take our citizens by the hand. As far as traceability is concerned, I do not know how many times I have said that we have tabled amendments, because there is no national plan on tampons. As Mr De Falco said very well before, it is the cost and accessibility of tampons that are the biggest differences between territories and regions. You, Mr Minister, have called for unity, which must be practiced through dialogue, also in Parliament, and this is where we must start if we really want to defend health. As for schools, there is an important proposal. Tuscany has taken a number of measures, from transport, to tutors who go to bus stops and help children keep their distance (the project is called Ti accompagno). We ask Minister Azzolina to take this initiative as a national experiment. What do we need?We cannot, after a year, be at the same level as last March. We have to get out of this lockdown. Vaccines will protect us, but we have to defend vaccines. How do we defend them?With rules, which we always ask our citizens to respect, and, for example, with a protocol for workers. Mr. Minister, let us not always be overwhelmed by problems without anticipating and addressing them. In the newspapers we read about the issue of dismissals of workers who do not want to be vaccinated. Mr. Minister, call the social partners together and we renew the protocol of 24 April last on work environments, which has allowed infections not to be so widespread in the workplace, and we discuss the specifics of different jobs together with the social partners. Vaccinations for the elderly should be done in the places closest to them. Therefore, we do not think that the elderly can be called by the ASL to go to who knows where to get vaccinated. We immediately involve general practitioners. Speaking of proximity, you appropriately set up a Commission chaired by Monsignor Paglia on the question of the review of RSA. We must move quickly on this aspect too, moving beyond the RSA model and promoting home-based integrated medicine especially for the elderly. I always hope that the Parliament can also talk about ESM resources, because this is the issue that needs to be addressed. I repeat, we are making a big plan for home care for the elderly. Moreover, it is not possible that in a pandemic situation there are still precarious people in the Agenas, among doctors, healthcare staff and social workers. We see this pandemic as a tremendous opportunity to have zero precariousness in health and social services. I personally proposed the establishment of a national health guard as we need to prepare for any other pandemics. We therefore need flexibility (and not just building facilities and intensive therapies) and ongoing training of health personnel and also volunteers who are periodically trained to respond to emergencies. Health, in fact, must cease to be culturally relevant to the sick, but must be protected and defended by those who are healthy. We must therefore focus on primary and secondary prevention, home care, digitization and local medicine. In the Health Committee we recently unanimously approved a resolution that talks about resuming care for non-Covid patients (for example oncological and cardiopathic), because it is absurd that they are neglected. With these figures, Mr Minister, and with the data you have brought with you regarding the fact that hospitals are filling up, we cannot afford to abandon more patients; therefore we must absolutely act in this direction. Mr Minister, colleagues, we must recover the beauty of everyday life, because our lives are turned upside down. For those who believe, the Pope on Sunday made a beautiful speech on the meaning of the baptism of Jesus. Jesus came among us to be close to us and to take up our daily lives. She called for unity and I appeal to her: to take up the daily life, the beauty of the daily life of our fellow citizens, we must first set an example. Let us take up the daily relationship between the Government and Parliament, even with the opposition, in a fruitful and productive dialectic for the good of the country.\\n\",\n",

With regard to the two main lines of action which the Government should have taken as a matter of great priority - I refer, on the one hand, to measures to contain health and, on the other, to measures to restrict and deprive the freedom of enterprise and individuals - we have seen you engaged only on the second, that is, on restricting. Minister, before I tell you the vote, I tell you what has not been done in the field of health containment: no tests have been done. Last Monday, we made 90,000 tampons; in England, we made 500. I would like to ask the Commissioner whether he is prepared to accept the amendments tabled by the Committee on the Environment, Public Health and Consumer Protection. We've been saying for months that, since the tracking system has been broken, and this is unfortunately a fact - that tampons, even quick ones, are used to identify people who are carriers of the virus without symptoms. It's such a trivial thing to do, doing it in such large numbers, that you don't understand what you're doing with this virus mapping. You haven't made home care protocols for general practitioners.

              " \"ERRANI (Misto-LeU). - (IT) Mr President, we thank the Minister, especially after his speech in this House today, for the work he is doing. It's not an easy job. There are many masters of commentary, but I challenge anyone to prove that in such a dramatic story there are those who already have the answers. I should like to ask you to be cautious. Even a description of reality in which it is said that nothing has been done, zero, that there are no results, that everything has to be done over again, in Bartali, does not do honour, in my opinion, even to the opposition, because you know very well that this is not the case. I would like to try to point out three things that we should all be thinking about. It is clear that vaccines open up a new condition, a positive outlook. In this regard, the comments made in the early days of the start of the vaccination campaign proved to be imprecise, to put it mildly. All the comments said that we had already failed the vaccination campaign, but the results so far are positive. Vaccination is a difficult and very complicated process. It is one thing to vaccinate, for example, healthcare workers and those working in RSAs, but it is another thing to vaccinate the masses to achieve herd immunity. And then - as has been rightly said - certain public functions require consistency: if an operator of a RSA decides not to vaccinate, it is legitimate, but he must choose not to operate in those structures anymore. I say this not to make an ideological controversy, but for a problem that - as we have seen - is very concrete. Mr. Minister, I think it is right to support all efforts at transparency on the issue of vaccines to allow even those who are not in the majority who support this Government to have all the elements and data at their disposal to use and interpret them. Let's make an extra effort, because at least on the issue of vaccines we could not say find a formal unity, but support a common commitment to achieve a result for all. The second point concerns the pandemic. I want to make a little personal observation that doesn't involve anyone. The data is growing, and there's no question about that. There is no point in continuing, depending on the position, to call for the opening or closing of businesses. Clearly, if countries such as Britain, Germany and the Netherlands - practically the whole of Europe - are further tightening the rules, there must be a reason. Can we say that it is the government's responsibility if the pandemic data is growing?No: if we look anywhere in Europe and the world, the data tells us that this is not the case. I say very clearly that, for the Christmas holidays, I was for a stricter solution; I understand all the problems, but I was for a stricter solution, because this is the only way today to reduce the growth of the pandemic. And I'm not the only one saying this, but - as you know - Fontana and Zaia have said it, because it's an objective fact, and we should therefore avoid fighting about it. We need a shift of 24 billion and we could work on another very important aspect - of course, if we start working on the merits and not on accusations, counter-accusations and controversies - and that is on building a restaurant system based on turnover and the tax mechanism. I make this argument, primarily aimed at the opposition, because I believe that the most critical elements are health and economic confusion and uncertainty. This is the effort that is required of us: an effort that is not of political positioning, but of opening a new phase in the country. You, the Minister, have always been consistent and have always come to this House, but what I fear most are the ritualistic assembly meetings in which they always say the same things and we fail to make a step forward. It is all very well to think about this, but let us take a few steps forward. From this discussion comes the message about the need for vaccinations and I appreciate what the opposition has said in this regard: no one is against vaccination. From this point of view, Minister, I personally think talking about white areas is a message. I 'm sorry .\\n\",\n",

First of all, Mr Zaffini said that in Europe we did everything wrong. I say that it is not at all so, as the scientists we have heard from in the Commission have also acknowledged. To the specific question about what we did wrong, they said: what could people do who didn't know which way to go. So it was done very well; obviously corrections needed to be made, but we didn't know what to expect. So it was done very well; obviously we need to make corrections, but we didn't know what to expect. So I have to say that, both in terms of the vaccination campaign that we are facing, and also in terms of what has been done before in the emergency, we have all tried. Other European countries are no better off than we are. As we know, we are now among the first regions in Europe to vaccinate, so we can also address this emergency. As we know, we are now among the first regions in Europe to vaccinate, so we can also address this emergency.

In all this, the fastest possible administration of the vaccine can allow us to return to normalcy in a short time, so it is right to immunize all health workers - as has been said, they are those who face the virus in the front row - as well as the weaker categories, arriving - as the National Vaccine Plan says very well - to vaccinate other categories, planning to anticipate the vaccination for teachers to promote the reopening of schools, which Senator I spoke very well about earlier, as many other colleagues have done.

While it is true that we need to get people out of hospitals and lighten our healthcare facilities, we believe that school is another fundamental and important factor. It is really about the health of our young people, including the mental discomfort they are experiencing right now. It is therefore a question of finding an adaptive strategy for pandemic planning and vaccination. Professor Brusaferro said that it will be necessary to assess situations and vaccinate in case of outbreaks. I am also thinking of other sectors, starting with transport, which must not only be reorganised; we must also think of transport operators, as well as the prison staff themselves, who are helping us at this time. I am also thinking of other sectors, starting with transport, which must not only be reorganised; we must also think of transport operators, as well as the prison staff themselves, who are helping us at this time. It is therefore - I repeat - a question of adapting in a flexible way what is a plan that we all know and which is very important to follow. Mr Minister, I would add that citizens are now very, very tested, and I am also thinking of their mental health, which I have just mentioned when I speak of young people. It is also important to address this aspect, which is not insignificant, because the psychological health of individuals is the psychological health of society as a whole, which is essential for maintaining it. As I feel and as I think we all see, people are starting to feel some resentment about what is happening. It is therefore essential that attention is also paid to psychological health, an important aspect which I therefore ask you to take into account.

I very much appreciated the way you used your serious tone and institutional seriousness today, Minister. If the whole Government had done so in these difficult months for everyone, we would have avoided some more trouble. You have today appealed to Parliament for accountability and unity. Let me welcome your appeal and let me also appeal from the opposition to the Government for accountability and unity. This is indeed the moment when the country cannot see any republican institution acting lightly and superficially. I say this because we are all aware that today a new and very delicate phase of the country is opening, in which the whistles and indecent shows are banned, which we have seen here, but also the easy triumphalisms that we have used in some phases of the management of the pandemic are banned. As Mr Errani said, we cannot deny that the data of the first phase, which are encouraging data on vaccinations, concern health workers at a time when vaccination of the population has not even begun. This is fundamental, without accusation or criticism. I am addressing Mr Errani specifically: we are ready to work in a loyal collaboration. He referred to the vaccine plan, the refreshments and the rules. Minister, the first ground on which to create collaboration is respect for Parliament: no more measures without the possibility of discussion, abuse of DPCM, budget laws not even open. Together with Mrs Bonino, Operation Plus Europe, we have tabled a resolution, and I thank her for the attention she has paid to it, which has three very simple points: sharing the vaccine plan with the Chambers, transparency and institutional communication, surveillance of immunological properties.\\n',\n",

Mr President, on 4 January the Government declassified the National Charter of Potentially Suitable Areas for the Storage of Nuclear Waste, which identifies some 60 potential sites throughout Italy, including 14 selected areas in Sardinia. The urgent need to make this map public stops, in order to start the complex procedure of identifying the most suitable site to receive this radioactive waste - the procedure will require, however, a time not less than forty-four months - let us think of the European infringement procedure, the costs we pay in the bill to store this waste, but above all the safety problems for the communities that live in the current sites now precarious. Despite this, however, we cannot fail to remind our rulers of the political and social position of the Sardinians on the issue.

              " 'With this provision, Canada, which has traditionally been a stranger to this type of system because it is geared to the trademark system, has recognized a number of European geographical indications, including 41 Italian ones which, moreover, represent about 90 per cent of the value of our PDO and PGI exports to Canada and are in addition to those of wines already recognized and protected.\\n',\n",

As for the geographical indications for which coexistence with trademarks already registered in Canada was envisaged (in particular, Parmigiano Reggiano, three Italian hams and three our cheeses), this solution, chosen to protect the rights acquired by local operators, has nevertheless allowed the protection of some European products previously considered generic names, as well as allowing the marketing of some products, in particular Parma ham. As regards the geographical indications for which coexistence with trademarks already registered in Canada was envisaged (in particular, Parmigiano Reggiano, three Italian hams and three our cheeses), this solution, chosen to protect the rights acquired by local operators, nevertheless allowed the protection of certain European products previously considered generic names, as well as allowing the marketing of certain products, in particular Parma ham. The latter, in fact, before CETA could not be entered on the Canadian market with its name, but only as original ham, given the existence of a trademark Parma registered forty years earlier. The latter, before CETA, could not be placed on the Canadian market with its name, but only as  original ham, given the existence of a trademark  Parma registered forty years earlier. In addition, the Agreement contains specific provisions against Italian sounding, such as the prohibition of evocation for non-originating products (i.e. the prohibition of the use of symbols, photos, colours and the like which may evoke the origin of the geographical indication), the obligation to indicate the origin on the label in a clear and visible manner, the obligation to further differentiate for products introduced on the market after a certain date, which must bear the indication of  use/imitation  style and so on, as well as the possibility of administrative recourse by the proprietors of individual intellectual property rights of geographical indications. Furthermore, the Agreement contains specific provisions against Italian sounding, such as the prohibition of evocation for non-originating products (i.e. the prohibition on the use of symbols, photographs, colours and the like which may evoke the origin of the geographical indication), the obligation to indicate the origin on the label in a clear and visible manner, the obligation for further differentiation for products placed on the market after a certain date, which must bear the words  style/imitation  and so on, and the possibility of administrative recourse by holders of intellectual property rights in individual geographical indications. In the light of the foregoing, therefore, and with reference to the further point made by the applicant concerning the timing of imports into the European Union of products bearing the designation Parmesan originating in Canada, it is clear that European legislation expressly prohibits their marketing, since the term Parmesan is not generic but is an evocation of the designation Parmigiano Reggiano and as such cannot be used in the European Union for cheeses which do not comply with the specifications of the Italian PDO. Import cases which infringe the exclusive right in the Union of the PDO Parmigiano Reggiano and its synonyms may be reported to the competent authorities of the Member States - in the case of Italy, it is the Central Authority for the Protection of Food Quality and the Suppression of Agricultural Fraud (RFICQ) and the Ministry of Agricultural Policy, in accordance with the Uniform Rules. Any cases of import infringing the exclusive right in the Union of the PDO Parmigiano Reggiano and its synonyms may be reported to the competent authorities of the Member States - in the case of Italy, it is the Central Inspectorate for the Protection of Quality and Combating Fraud in Agri-Food Products (ICQRF) of the Ministry of Agricultural, Food and Forestry Policies, pursuant to Union Regulation No 1151/2012 - which are obliged to take appropriate administrative and judicial measures to prevent or terminate the unlawful use of the Geographical Indications produced, protected or marketed in the Member State.1151/2012 - which are required to take appropriate administrative and judicial measures to prevent or put an end to the unlawful use of protected geographical indications produced or marketed in the Member State.

In relation to the issue of product protection on the Italian market and compliance with consumer labelling requirements, I would point out that the provision of clear, understandable and legible information on food for consumer protection - a matter harmonised at European level, where EU Regulation 1169/2011 ensures a high level of consumer protection, regulating all aspects of labelling - is a matter of utmost importance and commitment for this Ministry. Finally, in relation to the issue of product protection on the Italian market and compliance with consumer protection labelling requirements, I would point out that the provision of clear, understandable and legible information on consumer food - a matter harmonised at European level, where EU Regulation 1169/2011 ensures a high level of consumer protection, regulating all aspects of labelling - is of the utmost importance and commitment for this Ministry. This is evidenced, for example, by the letter signed jointly last March by Minister Bellanova and Minister of Economic Development Stefano Patuanelli, sent to the European Commissioners for Health and Agriculture, in which Italy requested that the obligation of origin on the label be extended to all foodstuffs, starting with a quick choice on these products, which have already been tested for years on raw materials such as processed milk, pasta, tomatoes, rice, caramelized rice. This is evidenced, for example, by the letter signed jointly by Minister Bellanova and Minister of Economic Development Stefano Patuanelli last March, sent to the European Commissioners for Health and Agriculture, in which Italy requested that the obligation of origin of the raw materials on the label be extended to all foods, starting with a quick choice on products on which it has already experimented in recent years such as milk, cheeses, processed meats, pasta, rice, tomato derivatives. With this in mind, the Ministers have notified Brussels of the extension until 31 December 2021 of the Decree of 9 December 2016 on milk and cheeses and have then signed the Ministerial Decree of 1 April 2020, which also extends the mandatory provisions of indication of origin, on the label, of durum wheat for durum wheat germ paste, rice and tomato derivatives until 31 December 2021. This is in the belief that in the Farm fork to strategy the mandatory origin must be a central theme, precisely because since that phrase translates from the mandatory field to ta, the origin best explains this interpretation, so that in the label the consumer has the perception of the origin or path of traceability. This is in the belief that in the Farm to Fork strategy the compulsory origin must be a central theme, precisely because since that phrase translates from the field to the table, the compulsory origin best declines this need, so that in the label the consumer has the perception of the entire traceability path. As for the control activities, with specific reference to the one set up by the Central Inspectorate for the Protection of Quality and Fraud Prevention of Agri-Food Products (ICQRF), the latter pays the utmost attention to the verification of the indication of origin reported on agri-food products. This is also done through sample checks of traceability, to ascertain its veracity, to counter the phenomenon of Italian sounding, to protect made in Italy and the most representative productions in this area, with particular reference to those protected by specific legislation of the European Union (PDO and PGI products). Through the assistance and cooperation systems between competent authorities of the Member States of the European Union Administrative assistance and cooperation system (AAC) and Food fraud network (FF), of which the ICQRF is the contact point for Italy together with the Ministry of Health, the reports exchanged with the authorities of other Member States concerning irregularities found on labelling devices are processed. The Administrative assistance and cooperation system (AAC) and the Food Fraud Network (FF), of which the ICQRF is the contact point for Italy together with the Ministry of Health, handle the reports exchanged with the authorities of other Member States concerning irregularities detected on labelling devices. Specific memoranda of understanding have also been signed with the main online trading platforms (eBay, Amazon, Alibaba) on web-based trade, strengthening the protection of consumers using these e-commerce platforms, as well as the promotion, promotion and information on Italian PDO and PGI products, so that the phenomena of misappropriation of Italian quality designations registered on the online market are counteracted. Specific Memoranda of Understanding have also been signed with the main online trading platforms (eBay, Amazon, Alibaba) on web commerce, strengthening the protection of consumers using these e-commerce platforms, as well as the promotion, promotion and information on Italian PDO and PGI products, in order to counter the phenomena of usurpation of Italian registered quality names on the online market. In response to the questions raised by the questioner as to whether Italy's ratification of CETA - instead of representing an opportunity for our country - would, on the contrary, become a vehicle for facilitating the importation of agri-food products with lower safety standards than those in Europe, I reply by pointing out that all agri-food products coming from Canada will have to comply with European sanitary and phytosanitary legislation, including the rules governing access to genetically modified organisms and products. Similarly, due to the precautionary principle - which is enshrined in Article 191 of the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union (TFEU) and is binding and cannot be amended or repealed by any international agreement, including CETA - and sanitary and phytosanitary legislation, products treated with substances that are banned as harmful (at present, the use of glyphosate is still authorised in the European Union) or for which there is no scientific evidence of harm but a suspected risk to human health, will not be able to enter the internal market of the European Union. Therefore, while the precautionary principle remains valid, the European Union will continue to apply its legislation on the prohibition of hormones in livestock, as provided for in Directive 96/22/EC, as amended by Directive 2003/74/EC. In addition, the import of untreated meat from third countries using hormones in livestock for their internal market is only possible if the segregation of farms is ensured, which also applies to the use of antibiotics banned in the European Union, as provided for in Directive 96/23/EC. In addition, the import of untreated meat from third countries that use livestock hormones for their internal market is only possible if livestock segregation is ensured, a principle which also applies to the use of antibiotics banned in the European Union, as provided for in Directive 96/23/EC. This principle was clearly reaffirmed in the declarations annexed to the European Council procedure for the adoption of the decision authorising the signature of CETA on behalf of the Union. This principle has been clearly reaffirmed in the declarations annexed to the procedure of the European Council for the adoption of the decision authorising the signature of CETA on behalf of the Union. Finally, while specifically addressing the issue of GMOs, it should be recalled that, with the implementation of Directive 2015/412/EU, the definitive ban on the cultivation of all varieties of MON810 maize in Italy (Commission Decision No. Finally, while specifically addressing the issue of GMOs, it should be recalled that the implementation of Directive 2015/412/EU has resulted in a definitive ban on the cultivation of all MON810 maize varieties in Italy (Commission Decision No 321 of 3 March 2016) and on all GM maize still being authorised for placing on the market.321 of 3 March 2016) and of all transgenic maize still being authorised for placing on the market. The cultivation of such transgenic maize, whether authorised or authorised, shall be punishable by the penalties provided for in Article 35a of Legislative Decree No. The cultivation of such GM maize, authorised or in the process of being authorised, shall be punishable by the penalties provided for in Article 35a of Legislative Decree No 224 of 8 July 2003.224. To date, no new marketing authorisation applications have been submitted for the cultivation of new GMOs, either for maize or other species. To date, no new applications for marketing authorisation have been submitted for the cultivation of new GMOs, whether for maize or other species. The current legislative system therefore allows action on all new GMOs for which a European cultivation authorisation is applied for, while at the same time the sanctioning system is able to punish all possible cases of infringement of the rules in force. Therefore, the current legislative system enables action to be taken on all new GMOs for which a European cultivation authorisation is requested, while at the same time the sanctioning system is able to punish all possible cases of infringement of the rules in force. As regards the legislation on labelling systems for food and feed containing genetically modified organisms, it is recalled that products, whether food or feed, consisting of, containing or derived from GMOs, are subject to the labelling and traceability requirements laid down in Community Regulations (EC) No 1829/2003 and (EC) No 1829/2003. This Regulation shall enter into force on the twentieth day following that of its publication in the Official Journal of the European Union.1830/2003. This ensures that information is provided to consumers and users of these products, enabling them to make an informed choice. This ensures that information is provided to consumers and users of such products, enabling them to make an informed choice. Regulation (EC) No 1829/2003 provides that foods derived from GMOs intended for the final consumer or food suppliers to the public are to be labelled with the statement on the presence of GMOs. Regulation (EC) No 1829/2003 provides that food derived from GMOs intended for the final consumer or food suppliers must bear on the label the statement on the presence of GMOs. In addition, Regulation No 1830 of 2003 also requires genetically modified food to comply with the requirements on traceability, defined as the ability to trace GMOs and products derived from GMOs at all stages from placing on the market through the production and distribution chain. To ensure traceability, operators handling products containing, consisting of or produced from GMOs are required to provide specific information to the subsequent operator in the chain at all stages of production and distribution. In order to ensure traceability, operators dealing with products containing, consisting of or produced from GMOs are required to provide specific information to the subsequent operator in the chain at all stages of production and distribution.

We expect from those who govern, independently of the Government and hoping that soon there will be a centre-right Government in Italy, the utmost commitment to defend the name and quality of our products, which are the best in the world. We demand that the government of any country should confront those who try to imitate our valuable products with similar products - you mentioned Parmesan several times - which have nothing to do with ours, but which in some way deceive consumers and threaten the economic and productive system of the country. We have been fighting for many years for the products that end up on our tables to be labelled and also traceable, as you said, so that they can be traced back to their origins and ingredients before they can become food. We, as a parliamentary group and as a party with our leader, Giorgia Meloni, will always keep our eyes peeled before any agreement - in this case CETA, an international agreement with Canada - because first and foremost we want Italy, our economy and our production system.

With all due respect and thanks to Undersecretary L'Abbate for his presence in this House and for the kindness with which he answered, even if unsatisfactory, the questions put, I would like to point out that I personally would have expected the presence of Minister Franceschini, that is, the Minister who has a delegation for tourism, or the Minister who has somehow a delegation for youth. For goodness sake, agriculture is always good, but it is certainly not the heart of the problem. What we are experiencing is one of the most dramatic economic and health emergencies that the country has ever experienced - it is said - since the end of World War II and we are facing a situation where we have all tourism stuck, with a dry loss that will mean that it will be years before the sector can be restarted. What we are experiencing is one of the most dramatic economic and health emergencies that the country has ever experienced - it is said - since the end of the Second World War and we are facing a situation in which we have all tourism blocked, with a dry loss that will make it take years before the sector can be put back into motion. However, within the framework of this tourism that we could define as non-profit, a service tourism, we have youth tourism, that is, the availability that allows a young person to broaden cultural horizons and also the social perspective, through this movement activity that allows Italian young people to have the experience of going abroad and those who come from abroad to come to Italy. It is obvious that in the lockdown, just as we are all locked in - and the next decree of the President of the Council of Ministers represents a further limitation on what we might call individual freedoms - we are depriving our young people of school attendance, of cultural experiences, even of deepening, those related to university life and internships, and in this case also of that capacity to broaden horizons. Let us not forget, however, that in the sixties the youth hostels themselves - and this is not an indifferent element - changed from the original designation of moral institutions to that of welfare institutions, because it seemed almost as if it were necessary to assist in some way from the economic and organizational point of view young people in their movements, then to the current one of cultural institutions. We are, therefore, once again considering the world of young people in the worst possible way, that is, not considering it. Clearly the answer and even the speech of my predecessor seems almost to look with greater interest at the guarantee of jobs, but we know that this guarantee is hanging by a thread, which we could call at the moment the famous thread of the integrated fund and which will be subject to the cut of 30 March, when the ban on redundancies will be lifted. It is clear that the answer and also the speech of the colleague who preceded me seem almost to look with greater interest at the guarantee of jobs, but we know that this guarantee is hanging by a thread, which we could call at the moment the famous thread of the integrated fund and which will in any case be subject to the cut of 30 March, when the ban on dismissals will be lifted. We are facing a political attitude capable of turning over to this sector the blindness of a country that does not consider tourism its real black gold. The example of tourism as the black gold of the country is an example that was made by Minister Franceschini, Minister for two legislatures. Now we do not know what will happen in the next Government: maybe Minister Franceschini will become the Head of Government and maybe, if so, he will give tourism and culture a much greater importance than it has been until now, but we know that this kind of black gold, which is Italian tourism, has never been able to be taken into account as the country's own wealth, an economic wealth, an enogastronomic wealth - and this certainly also concerns his skills - a cultural wealth that is tradition, but also the ability to look ahead. Now we do not know what will happen in the next Government: perhaps Minister Franceschini will become the Head of Government and maybe, if so, he will give tourism and culture a much greater importance than he has until now, but we know that this kind of black gold, which is Italian tourism, has never been able to be properly considered as the country's own wealth, an economic wealth, a wine and gastronomic wealth - and this certainly also concerns his skills - a cultural wealth that is made of tradition, but also of the ability to look forward. I think it is ridiculous today to ask this question about youth hotels: when the colleague put his question, as you know, there was still no pandemic, when I put mine we were in the phase of broadening the horizons, in the perspective of returning to a potential normality, while today we are sinking into a dramatic black hole from which we do not even know when and how we will be able to get out, given the impossibility of moving from one municipality to another or from one region to another. This means serious myopia of government, from a cultural, economic, social and organizational point of view, and it means blindness to the rights of the new generations. Other than the recovery plan as a right of the next generation! This is really blindness. This is really blindness. I can only take this moment to say that we hope that some good can come from evil.

On the same day, the excellent journalist Claudia Procentese published a post on her Facebook page, through which, with absolutely talking images, the national community came to know about this demolition, carried out in a few hours on the same day, then again on July 9 last year, so much so that then, as the Undersecretary said, the superlocation of the Superintendence for the metropolitan area of Naples is July 13.19 of 2009, the so-called house plan, which in Campania allows reconstructions even with increased cubature, where there is no prohibition with respect to any prescriptions of the Superintendence. Forgive me the expression, but the Ministry can not \"get away\" by claiming that the building was not protected. However, before deciding its fate, the Superintendence or the Municipality (a territorial body) would have had to initiate the procedure of verification of the cultural interest. This was neither done nor requested. The Superintendence claims to have been aware of what was happening at the time of the demolition, however, it admits that eighteen months earlier, i.e. in January 2019, based on a request from the previous October, it had answered a question about the binding situation by the notary in charge of the firm that carried out the demolition. This should have been an alarm bell, such as to simply induce the Superintendence, or someone inside it - we are talking about this, not street people - to make a phone call to the Municipality of Giugliano to know if it had given or was going to give the permission to demolish a historic building, on which there was no explicit constraint, but which certainly, being eighteenth century, had exceeded seventy years, so it was protected ex lege. There was then an involuntary complicity in turning the gaze the other way and we lost an important piece of the history of the territory. The associations Italia Nostra and Architetti in rete (AIR) have made a proposal for the acquisition of an item within the current General Regulatory Plan (GRP) for the protection of historic rural buildings. This is a countrywide problem. A national strategy for the protection of historic rural building heritage is needed.

Mr President, a week ago, on 7 January, in Il Giorno, in the pages of Milan, an article appeared that, for the first time, gave an account of the state of the art of negotiation between the State and Umberto Eco's heirs. Umberto Eco was a great narrator, philosopher, semiologist, journalist, who passed away exactly five years ago, in February 2016. He was born in January 1932 and now, after five years, those conversations - started about three years ago - between the family and the State - I refer to that article, followed, in the following days, by other interventions in the press - seem to arrive in port. He was born in January 1932 and now, five years later, those conversations - started about three years ago - between the family and the State - I refer to that article, followed, in the following days, by other interventions in the press - seem to be coming to fruition. Yet, unlike what was known until some time ago, namely that the Ministry for Cultural Heritage and Activities was dealing with the family, after having declared the particularly important historical interest of the compendium consisting of the library and archive of Umberto Eco, today we learn that the library, in relation to the part of the ancient and rare texts, will actually be purchased by the State and will be kept in the Braidense National Library of Milan and managed, precisely, by the Ministry. However, contrary to what was known until some time ago, namely that the Ministry for Cultural Heritage and Activities was dealing with the family, after having declared the particularly important historical interest of the compendium consisting of the library and archive of Umberto Eco, today it is learned that the library, in relation to the part of the ancient and rare texts, will actually be purchased by the State and will be kept in the national library Braidense in Milan and managed, precisely, by the Ministry. On the contrary, over 35,000 volumes - they are the most recent part of the library itself - and the papers, therefore the professor's archive, will be donated by the family to the State, but they will go to Bologna, and therefore not to Milan. In Bologna the University Alma Mater Studiorum, on the basis of an agreement with the family, which seems to have yet to be reached, will make available the spaces - they seem to have already been identified - to collect this part of the documentation and the books.

As I said, the library partly remains in Milan, partly goes to Bologna, the archive seems to go to Bologna.

According to the statutes of Consap, the directors are appointed for a period not exceeding three years, and they expire on the date of the meeting. Thus, Masi, unable to take up the role of CEO for the fourth time, obtained the presidency, while the chair of CEO went to Vincenzo Federico Sanasi D'Arpe. The statutes of CONSAP also state that only the managing director and the president may be awarded remuneration of between 160,000 and 180,000 in the case of delegation of operational tasks. This is the first time that the Commission has taken a decision on this matter. Consap manages, on behalf of the Mise, the Ministry of the Interior and the MEF, the role of public insurer for compensation and therefore manages certain compensation funds such as the guarantee and securitisation fund for losses provided for by the decree-law.

Consap also manages the savers' compensation fund (FIR) provided for in Law No 145 of 30 December 2018, i.e. compensation for savers who have suffered unfair prejudice, i.e. failed banks. Massi is also president of Banca Igea, another bank whose joint stock company saved Banca del Fucino, with 47,5 million losses; operation carried out through the transfer of 314 million non-performing loans (NPL) to the company for the management of activities that was SGA ex Banco di Napoli and became AMCO, a company participating in the MEF. Masi is also chairman of Banca Igea, another bank whose holding company rescued Banca del Fucino, with losses of 47.5 million, through the sale of 314 million non-performing loans (NPL) to the asset management company that was SGA formerly Banco di Napoli and became AMCO, a company owned by the MEF. As Rai's managing director, Masi was convicted of money laundering in relation to the public TV station and had to compensate the company for €100,000. As Director-General, he encouraged the exodus of the former director of the newspaper, Angela Buttiglione, and of the former director of Rai, Marcello del Bosco. As general director, he encouraged the exodus of the former director of the newspaper Angela Buttiglione and the former director of Rai Marcello del Bosco, making Rai pay out 680,000 euros; a figure that the Court of Auditors judged to be pecuniary damage with a judgment confirmed by the Court of Cassation on 16 October 2018.

              " 'At the beginning of this experience of government - on 9 September 2019 - I foreshadowed, precisely in this Chamber, a clear political project for the country. I immediately made it clear that the programme on which I was going to ask Parliament for confidence did not and could not be resolved in a mere list of heterogeneous proposals, nor, even less, in a sterile summary of the positions taken by each of the political forces that would have supported the majority. Already then I was aware that an alliance between political formations from different histories, traditions, experiences and cultures, which - in addition - had also been completely opposed, sometimes even in a very harsh way, in the most recent international scenario, could only arise on the basis of two fundamental differences: the European leadership, not only extrinsically interdependent, but also a convinced anchorage between the values of the Italian people - a way of recovering the role of the protagonist, even in the geopolitical and geopolitical context, in the European Union - and of making it possible to return to the role of the protagonist, in the first place, as the main protagonist, and in the second place, as a means of protecting the European identity, in the context of the European Union. From the moment the programme was drawn up, in which I myself participated, together with the delegations of the majority political forces, we all worked together to ensure that the perspective of a broad and courageous reform project was drawn up. I said then that this political project would mark the beginning of a new - which we all hoped for and still hope for - reform season, aimed at building a fairer and more inclusive society, able to combine the primary objective of economic growth, revitalisation and modernisation with the essential requirements of sustainability, social and territorial cohesion, in the context of the full development of the person. At the beginning of 2020, the conditions for the implementation of that project were measured, unfortunately, with the hurricane of the pandemic; it was and is a hurricane that has upset and is profoundly upsetting our society, our lifestyle habits, our collective destiny. The pandemic has forced us to redefine our priorities, to rethink our development model, the very dynamics of our relations. We are facing a challenge of epochal scope, we are measuring ourselves with the need to define the reconstructive lines of a society that is marked anew (seems to be a re-raining in the past) by primordial fears, often known precisely for generations of the past, as well as the risk of losing essential bonds between health, life and well-being, all of which are deeply fragile. Some of our deep-rooted convictions have suddenly been called into question. Politics itself has been forced to confront, almost daily, perhaps as never before, science and technology in the difficulty of providing effective and rapid responses to an overwhelming health emergency and a severe economic recession. Even our most established legal knowledge has been severely challenged. The state of emergency has forced us to introduce, first in the West, with all the doubts, perplexities and difficulties, and of course soon afterwards in all the other countries, restrictive measures of human rights, making very delicate and laborious balances between constitutional principles and rights. In these dramatic months, even in the face of unprecedented complexity, this majority has managed to demonstrate great responsibility, achieving, with some difficulty, convergences of views and resolutions of action, as was required especially in the most critical stages. We have cultivated a constant and close dialogue with all the institutional levels of our system, from the regional authorities to those of the municipalities, in the awareness that only by practicing regularly, in an unconventional way, the principle of cooperation, it would be possible to pursue the strategies that are considered to be effective in this area, especially in the areas of health. Not only that; the experience of the pandemic has strengthened in the political forces, which have loyally supported the Government, the awareness of the value of dialogue and dialectical confrontation between even distant positions, which is an inescapable premise to make the most correct choices, to make those superior syntheses in the highest collective interest, to take the fundamental decisions from which, due to the gravity of the hour, we could not escape. Everyone on the spot will express their opinions; we are in the field of the opinable. For my part, I can say that the Government has operated the delicate balances and constitutional interests involved from time to time with the utmost scruple and with the utmost care, in the awareness of the immense consequences that would have occurred in the lives of individuals and for the future of our community. If today, to you who are in this Chamber and to the citizens who follow us from home, I can speak with a high head, it is not because of the arrogance of those who believe that they have never made a mistake, but because of the awareness that, together with the entire government team, they have committed all their physical and intellectual energies, to offer the best possible protection to the national community.\\n',\n",

I would also like to mention two measures to give meaning to interventions that express a vision for the country, aimed at improving the competitiveness of our productive fabric, made up mainly of small and medium-sized enterprises; but of course also large enterprises are struggling in this context of crisis. I am referring to the SME Equity Fund, managed by Invitalia, which promotes the capitalization of small and medium-sized enterprises that invest in their relaunch, and the Destined Equity Fund, managed by Cassa depositi e prestiti, which can contribute not only to the support but also to the growth of enterprises with a turnover of more than EUR 50 million. Then, also in view of the great challenge of the recovery plan, we wanted to redefine with clarity the regulatory framework to support investments, in particular those in infrastructure. In fact, we have defined an accelerated path for the implementation of public works; we have intervened to redefine very carefully the system of liability of the public administration, in particular with regard to the redefinition of pecuniary liability, to the delimitation of the offence of abuse of office. In this respect, I often hear the objection raised (and I have to say that it happened yesterday in the House) that, after a few months, the works, even if they were considered priority in the framework of the simplification decree, would still be blocked, because the designation of the relevant Commissioners would be missing. These works have never been blocked, because Article 2 of the simplification decree has been applied, which gives special powers specific to the commissioners to the RUP (the sole project managers). We have reached a total of 43.3 billion compared to 39.4 billion in 2019.

Yesterday I announced to the House, in the field of electoral law, the commitment of the Government, of course respecting the autonomous determinations of the parliamentary forces, to promote and contribute to achieving an electoral reform, as far as competence is concerned, of a proportional system, as much as possible shared (because it is a system law), which can effectively combine the reasons for pluralism and representation with the need, although inescapable, to ensure an overall stability of the political system. I would like to clarify this point, because I am reading malicious interpretations, so to speak. In recent years we have seen a fragmentation of representation. The framework of political forces has become differentiated and new processes have emerged, which have established themselves in a completely new and even disruptive way. If we want to reconstruct this picture, it is not possible to do so with an electoral law that forces so different sensibilities into the same envelope. If we want to reconstruct this picture, it is not possible to do so with an electoral law that forces so different sensibilities into the same envelope. This would lead to political instability and uncertainty and would not stabilise the situation. Rather, it seems to me urgent to offer and contribute to the pursuit, as far as reason is concerned, of an instrument which can also make full use of its capacity to promote the democratic representation of all the differences on the ground, so that the various political forces can express their full potential, recover even from abstentionism distrusted citizens and define their profile sure and credible.

Obviously, these political forces, to govern, will be called upon to define programmatic agreements of high content and strong profile ideal, so as to generate governments based on clear programmes and able to offer a solid and fruitful perspective to all citizens. Of course, these political forces, in order to govern, will be called upon to define high-profile programmatic agreements with a strong ideal content, in order to generate governments based on clear programmes and capable of offering a solid and fruitful perspective to all citizens. The amendment of the electoral system can also be effectively accompanied by certain innovations in the institutional system, all the more necessary in view of the reduction in the number of parliamentarians, in line with the directions already shared by the majority parliamentary groups in the agreement reached in October 2019. It is then necessary to introduce some corrections to the form of government, inspired by the model of a rationalized parliamentarism that guarantees a more secure stability to the Executive and, at the same time, returns to Parliament a central role in defining the national political direction. As regards in particular the legislative procedure, some provisions aimed at rationalizing the approval of laws may be introduced, also in order to reduce the use of emergency decree, which in fact in the last year, due to the pandemic, has even more significantly increased or conditioned parliamentary activity.

To do all this, we need a Government and parliamentary forces willing and aware of the difficulties we are facing and the sensitivity of the tasks; we need people willing to recognise the importance of politics. In the opening part of my speech I claimed the political character of the choices made and the decisions taken. Politics is the noblest of the arts and of the sciences, because, if it is pursued in the right spirit and is always and in any case aimed at the well-being of citizens and the improvement of the quality of life, it becomes a very effective tool also for resolving the conflicts in society, for recognizing and coexisting differences and for interpreting situations, even the most diverse and distant. When politics is eclipsed, these demands end up on the margins, with the risk that they will remain unheard and therefore unheard or, worse, that they will turn into anger and lead to violent clashes. We have an urgency to do politics, all the more so in this context of widespread deprivation and deep suffering, because only politics offers us the possibility of interpreting the malaise of society, preventing it from exploding into destructive oppositions. Politics can help to make this malaise a productive and positive factor, a factor for the progress of the Nation. It is up to us, therefore, to promote and contribute to putting into political form the contradictions, aspirations, needs and the will on the part of all to express their potential. I think first of all of the workers and all the productive forces, which are the decisive components to be encouraged and promoted for the future of the Republic. This Government intends to pursue a clear and precise political project, which aims to modernize the country, improving its material and immaterial infrastructure, making the energy and digital transition and strengthening social inclusion, all in the name of sustainable development: it will be our northern star.\\n',\n",

Many in this House met her during the last parliamentary term and could see in her an unusual, intelligent, determined, hardworking and passionate woman.

Her other passion was culture, as you, Mr President, recalled well. Her other passion was culture, as you, Mr President, have well recalled. For two terms in the House, she was a reference on this subject, but, beyond the political sensitivity that led her to work to support culture and make it accessible to everyone, Emilia really understood culture, music and theatre: she had so much to teach about this and this sensitivity gave her the opportunity to cultivate so many relationships and to get in touch with worlds often far from politics.

In this branch of Parliament Emilia then worked for an entire term as President of the Health Committee: she did so while important and controversial issues were being discussed.

Mr President, I met Senator Emilia De Biasi at the beginning of last year's parliamentary term, at the inauguration of the Health Committee of which I was a member and of which she became chair. Emilia De Biasi was also passionate about the Aosta Valley. For some years she attended the Municipality of Gaby in the Gressoney valley and on those occasions I had the pleasure of accompanying her to visit the socio-health facilities of my Region, always showing her great attention to the provision of services in the territories, and to host her also on the occasion of conferences in which she participated with competence and passion. I remember that, when we met here in the Senate, she greeted me with a  Bonjour, monsieur le sénateur , as I am called in my country, with a rotating R that made the French impeccable. I would like to mention briefly how important your political work and your role as President of the Health Committee were in enabling the adoption of important laws such as the one on the reorganisation of the health professions, the one containing provisions on the safety of health care for citizens and on the professional responsibility of health professionals. I still remember very well the passion and competence of her speeches in the Aula. Dear Emilia, thank you for all these struggles and for your commitment to a more just society supporting, in particular, the rights of women and the most vulnerable and, above all, thank you for your friendship.

              " 'LAFORGIA (Misto-LeU). Mr President, it is very painful for me to remember Emilia, not only because we are talking about a dear person who is no longer here, but also because, as far as I am concerned, the memory of Emilia brings back to me the memory of a common militancy and a common path, which were important and fundamental in my political biography. I am referring to definitely different experiences; when I met Emilia I was first a militant and then a young party leader, while Emilia had already accumulated a long political experience, on the territory and also at the national level. But she was crossed by the awareness that one of the functions of political communities and parties should be to identify and select the ruling class and to make it grow, in a relationship between generations that had to be frank and dialectical. I say this with a smile, because those who know Emilia know what it means to have a dialectical relationship with her (using a euphemism, of course). This relationship was always centered on the awareness that the ruling classes do not fall from the sky, but are the result of a patient and constant construction, of a relationship and a confrontation, even between representatives of different generations and different paths. I owe a lot to Emilia also from this point of view. She thought that there were no battles for women, battles for LGBT rights, battles for childhood, battles for fragility, but that each battle lived on the strength of battles for others and that strengthening the rights of each meant strengthening the rights of all others. This was her thought, this was her conviction and I believe that the debt we owe to a personality, with a figure like Emilia is exactly this: to understand, in the new world we are entering, the importance of this kind of reflection, which she naturally made live in the exercise of her parliamentary function and in her political initiative. She did so as President of the Commission for Health and Hygiene, but she did so in general in her struggles, so we will miss her thinking, her initiative, her expertise in this very difficult time we are going through. We will also miss that smile and that overwhelming laughter that was noticeable every time we confronted her and that was the conclusion of any confrontation, even the harshest. Thank you Emilia, we will miss you very much.',\n",

I had the honour of being Vice-President in the last parliamentary term when you were President of the Health Committee. We fought many battles together, but real battles, sometimes, of course, because of differences of opinion.

These are the four words that I have in my heart and that she defended without fear in front of anyone. These are the four words that I have in my heart and that she defended without ever being afraid of anyone.

I had the opportunity and the honour of being with her in the 16th Parliament in the 7th Commission, so that I could grasp all the aspects of her personality: the aspect of a Member who went into detail about every measure, as well as her polemical vis. I remember, in moments of great tension, her sharp words, which I think are unforgettable for everyone. She was incredible and did not give up because she always had to bring the comparison of ideas to the end. I remember her attitude always very serious and responsible and the love that shone even from the treatment of the various measures; a great love for culture in any form, be it music, books, publishing or her blog on rock. She was truly multifaceted, with an extraordinary enthusiasm and a desire to live every moment with great intensity. I think her characteristic was exactly this: her enthusiasm for life and her work and her desire to also participate in the battles for gender equality and against violence against women, which I assure you were not so easy then as they are today. We also had a lot of discussions on this subject. On other matters we had very different views, but we never lacked respect and esteem. As we all know, in the end you live more with your colleagues in the Commission than with your family. It was a constructive relationship because, as has already been said, Emilia also liked to compare and there was always a way of communicating and learning from each other, an attitude - this - which I really like and try to practice every day. On behalf of the League-Salvini Premier-Sardinian Action Party Group, I would therefore like to offer my condolences to the family and colleagues and friends of the Democratic Party Group, who with Emilia lose not only a friend, but a fundamental component, for how she wanted to live her political passion, 100 percent, but also all the other aspects of life.\",\n",

First a member of the PCI, to which she gave her contribution, for its transformation and for the construction of the PDS and then, gradually, up to the founding manifesto of the PD. She was a municipal councillor in Milan for the PDS, twice deputy, in the XV and XVI legislature and then senator in the XVII legislature. She said: Women, culture, information and work are the four words that are close to my heart and in fact her action has always been directed at the defence of women, their rights, gender equality in every sphere, whether in the family, at work, in society and in political life. In the cultural sphere, her contribution has been tangible, as demonstrated by the approval of the law on live entertainment, but also the law on fair remuneration for freelance journalists, the reform of publishing, tax relief measures for cinema and the recognition of unemployment benefits for artists. As her colleagues recalled, she was Chair of the Senate's Hygiene and Health Commission in the last legislature and in this field she has also made a tangible and concrete contribution, working to achieve important progress on civilization and respect for the dignity of patients. I am referring in particular to advance treatment arrangements, an issue which in Italy is always particularly sensitive, to informed consent and to the responsibility of healthcare professionals. She has also committed herself to the approval of the reform of the health professions, to the strengthening and modernisation of the National Health Service, to ensuring its universality and fairness, especially towards the most vulnerable groups. It can be said with certainty that she has always worked for the enhancement of what we might call the human capital of our National Health Service and to promote dialogue and discussion between institutions and organisations of citizens and patients. It is precisely because of her unwavering commitment to health that she received, in 2016, from the GIMBE Foundation, the award entitled Let's save our national health service. Some choices have divided us, as is normal and as happens in politics, but I can say with confidence that, with the death of Emilia De Biasi, we lose a woman who dedicated her life to others and politics, always attentive to the needs of citizens and to respect and strengthening the republican institutions.\",\n",

The Convention on the Elimination of Violence and Harassment in the World of Work, adopted last June on the occasion of the centenary of the creation of the International Labour Organisation (ILO), is rightly described as a landmark ruling because it represents a concrete step forward. First of all, it provides a broad definition of violence and harassment: a definition that includes not only physical but also verbal abuse, as well as phenomena such as stalking and mobbing, because it explicitly refers to gender-based violence and harassment that can cause physical, psychological, sexual but also economic harm. It also covers volunteers, people in training, traineeships and apprenticeships, and even those who are looking for work or workers whose relationship has been terminated. Another positive aspect is that violence or harassment is also recognised when it occurs outside the workplace, in the physical sense, and therefore includes all behaviour that occurs, for example, during business trips and social events, as well as in the context of communications that take place via telematics. This is particularly important in view of the increase in sexual harassment on new social networks such as WhatsApp, which are less formal but equally insidious. The Convention also provides for a wide range of obligations for States and, subsequently, for employers, who are no longer only able but also obliged to guarantee the protection of all those involved in the workplace. By ratifying this Convention, we are, in essence, promoting a reversal of the cultural approach and of the collective approach to the phenomenon. Among other things, obligations are foreseen for the various States, including the introduction of decisive powers for labour inspectors and other supervisory authorities. Today, it is estimated that 80 per cent of women who experience abuse at work or by their managers often do not report or talk about it just to live quietly or for fear of scandal or retaliation. However, this violence often affects those who are most vulnerable in the world of work. It is a change, a turning point. It is a question of promoting a cultural revolution which makes possible a change of pace. This is also why it is important today to ratify this Convention. I hope that the vote will bring together the different political forces, unlike what happened in the Commission, because one cannot speak of interference with national law. When it comes to protecting the dignity of workers, there must be no justification or excuse because the only interference is that which treats the body of others as if it were an object of their own property, at work and outside.',\n",

Another distinctive element I would like to emphasise is the approach. It is in fact a broader approach, which leads to the conclusion that violence and harassment in the workplace affect everyone, men and women, unfortunately in the awareness and statistical evidence that women are affected more and disproportionately; the data speaks about three times as many cases as men.

Another consideration: the Convention calls for violence and harassment in the workplace, but it also involves and seeks to address a complex array of issues, as has already been mentioned. I am referring to mobbing, stalking, psychological violence, the issue of worker protection and how to prevent and deal with violence and harassment. There is also a further step: a broad interpretation is meant precisely because it looks at a set of behaviours, practices and acts intended to cause or even threaten physical, psychological and economic harm, or which is intended to be a sexual offence or gender-based violence. There is also a further step: it is a broad interpretation precisely because it looks at a set of behaviours, practices and acts intended to cause or even threaten physical, psychological and economic harm, or which are - it is envisaged - configured as a sexual offence or as gender-based violence. Another forward-looking element of the Convention is that it is addressed to all types of workers, i.e. not only to employees, and not only to workplaces - I want to emphasize this - but also to those that I allow myself to define as not only places, which are nevertheless only connected to the world of work, i.e. for example, work trips, job training courses away from the usual workplace, but also the means of communication and information, chats, e-mails and WhatsApp, that is, all those offensive messages, which we know can be used in an invasive way, such as text messages, images and even threatening messages, as well as text messages and messages, which can be used in an aggressive way, as we well know, as text messages and even threatening messages. Another forward-looking element of the Convention is that it is addressed to all types of workers, that is to say not only to employees, and not only to workplaces - I would like to emphasize this - but also to those which I may call non-places, but which are nevertheless linked to the world of work, i.e. for example, business trips, vocational training courses away from the usual place of work, but also to the means of communication and information such as chats, text messages, e-mails, WhatsApp messages, i.e. all those tools which, as we know, can be used in an invasive, pervasive and I would even say distorting way, becoming aggressive, offensive and threatening through the transmission of video, images or text. This is why the Convention makes an effort to include them. Before concluding, I want to go back to the statistical evidence from which I started, referring to the only survey we have practically, however dated. Before concluding, I would like to return to the statistical evidence from which I started, referring to the only survey we have practically, however dated. I am referring to the 2016 Istat survey on the safety of citizens, which also addresses the chapter on violence and harassment at work and sexual blackmail. One of the statistics provided by Istat is that 1.404 million women have experienced physical harassment and sexual harassment at work in their lifetime, or 8.9 percent of the female workforce. The survey also found that over 425,000 women, or 2.7 percent, experienced these episodes in the three-year period 2013-2016. It is clear that the figures are quite different when we talk about violence outside the workplace (those I mentioned are confined to the workplace). It is clear that the figures are quite different when we talk about violence outside the workplace (those I mentioned are confined to the workplace). Cases involve physical contact, requests for sexual services or availability in exchange for a promotion or job or promotion, promotion or threat of dismissal. The Institute notes that in over 80% of cases victims do not report or tell anyone what happened to them: only 0.7% of victims do. The same Institute notes that in more than 80 per cent of cases victims do not report or tell anyone what happened to them: only 0.7 per cent of victims do. Of course, all the victims interviewed by the Istat stress that these incidents have changed their lives, both personally and professionally, because many of them have been fired or have resigned, or have not been hired or have been dismissed. Surely, however, all the victims interviewed by the Istat point out that these incidents have changed their lives, both personal and professional, because many of them have been fired or have resigned, or have not been hired or have been dismissed. The Fratelli d'Italia Group, both here in the Senate and in the Chamber, will therefore vote convincingly in favour of this measure.

              " 'We hope that Italy, as a country, as a nation, will not merely ratify the Convention, but will follow it in its application, accompanying it with a series of measures to consolidate the application of this principle, because at the same time we must also tackle other issues, such as the disparity in pay for equal work; we must allow equal access to jobs and careers for women too; we must ensure that maternity is a free choice and not a conditional choice and I could go on, because the matter is complex.',\n",

              " \"DE PETRIS (Misto-LeU). - (FR) Mr President, I believe that today is a very important day and frankly I regret that the House is rather distracted in discussing the ratification of this very important convention. It is a solemn undertaking that our country is taking on at this moment and is finally going to approve and ratify the Convention itself. Compared to other conventions, we have succeeded in getting it approved fairly quickly, since in this Chamber we are used to ratifying treaties signed many years before. Above all, we have to deal - this is the really important part of this ratification - with the data that my colleague before me was reminding us of. The European Union Agency's survey on violence against women says that one in two women say they have experienced some form of sexual harassment at work. In 32 per cent of cases the harasser is a colleague, a subordinate or a superior, and these figures are dramatic. Even more dramatic are the data of the 2016 Istat survey, which shows that in Italy there are 1,400,000 women affected by forms of harassment, violence, blackmail and other forms of sexual blackmail. When women are interviewed, when they are selected, the first thing they are asked is whether they intend to have children. This is the other element of deep discrimination. This occurs at the time of recruitment, but also during the career, with all that goes with it. 32.4% of these blackmailings are repeated daily; 17.4% about once a week; 29.4% sometimes a month and 19.2% more rarely. If we then read these figures on the basis of the fact that in our country we have a very high female employment deficit (18% less than male employment, which unfortunately, as we know, is what it is these days), we are faced with a really dramatic figure. Eighty-one per cent of the victims interviewed never spoke about it and less than one per cent then had the courage to report what had happened or managed to find some form of socialization. That is why I say that ratifying the Convention in question today is of fundamental importance, because thanks to it we have at our disposal a real tool in the fight against violence and harassment committed in the world of work, we are doing a fundamental act to support women and anyone who is subjected to this kind of blackmail in the workplace and above all to give them the possibility and the force of respect for their dignity. Let us think about the figures I told you about earlier, about how many women are forced to change jobs and quit or have been fired. The scope is precisely the protection of workers, irrespective of their contractual status, in a world of work which is so fragmented and changing, and in which there are now so many different forms of work. This includes volunteers, trainees, trainees, apprentices and jobseekers: there is therefore a very wide range of protection. The Convention provides for a wide range of protection and prevention measures, with obligations on States, and therefore on our State, to adopt all internal provisions defining violence and harassment and all measures to prevent these harmful behaviours, including from a compensatory and repressive point of view. This means that it requires States to ensure that potential victims have effective access to justice, by preparing measures to remedy them. The Convention devotes particular attention to gender-based violence and above all seeks to do political and cultural advocacy and training work; this is the other fundamental element. Today we are about to approve - I am sure, unanimously - a very important ratification, a very important ratification. Of course, we all hope - because I think we all agree on this - that we will be able to make the best use of this instrument, including the obligation it imposes on the State to adopt all the acts and legislative provisions which make it possible to extend the system of protection and, above all, to prevent.\",\n",
              " \"ROSSOMANDO (PD). - (PT) Mr President, ladies and gentlemen of the Government, ladies and gentlemen, in our country 9 per cent of women have been physically harassed or sexually blackmailed while at work. If a woman is sexually blackmailed, 80 percent of the time she does not tell anyone at work; almost no one reports it, yet at least 70 percent of women who have been sexually blackmailed find it very or fairly serious.33 percent of these women have voluntarily changed jobs or quit their careers because of sexual harassment at work; 10 percent have been fired or put into a reintegration box. This is the framework under which the International Labour Organisation adopted, on 21 June 2019, the Convention on the Elimination of Violence and Harassment in the Workplace, with an overwhelming majority of Member States. Work is the place of people's rights and emancipation and I am proud that Italy will be the first of 187 Member States to ratify this Convention. Italy is a country that already has anti-discrimination and worker protection rules, but today we are approving a framework and a very innovative protection programme. I would like to emphasise the international nature of this regulatory framework. We are now accustomed to associating the word globalisation with the loss of rights and the deterioration of working conditions. We want to reverse this equation and for there to be a globalisation of rights against the exploitation of people, a globalisation no longer driven by the unregulated market and outside the cooperation of States, which too often has led to a loss of dignity for people and caused social tensions and mistrust in citizenship relations. It is therefore time for the globalisation of the rights and dignity of the person, with his freedoms and the right to freely choose his own living conditions and future. Violence and harassment in the workplace are violations of human rights and this type of violence, which translates into physical, verbal and blackmailing harassment, is unfortunately still covered by silence, silence and lack of solidarity, much more than in other cases of violence - already reprehensible. As I said, almost 90 percent of women who suffered did not report it. First of all, an expansion of the definition of violence or harassment, but above all of the place: the place of work is not only the physical place of the establishment, but it can also be the home or a place of travel and - attention - in the Covid era, at a time when there is a lot of teleworking, in which smart working is used, there has been an increase in violence both in domestic locations and through computer means, so this is very important. There is an obligation of the Member States to prescribe and the employer to adopt preventive and repressive measures and there is an obligation to guarantee access to justice, as well as a greater involvement of labour inspectors. Our country, in fact, as has been said, does not go unnoticed on this issue. I would like to recall two issues for everyone: in the 2018 budget law we introduced the prohibition on dismissal, dismissal and transfer following a complaint of sexual harassment, as well as the nullity of retaliatory dismissal or the dismissal of the complainant, in addition - of course - to the prohibition on blank dismissal. The main cause, however, lies in the power imbalance between perpetrators and victims of violence. I would like to recall the words of Guy Ryder, Director-General of the ILO, when he says that these rights must be put into practice in order to create a better, safer and more dignified working environment for women and men. We talk a lot about investment and work at this difficult time for our country, for all European democracies and worldwide. Investing in work and its quality also means investing in its dignity, which is a very important factor of social cohesion, belonging and redemption of people, because it marks the relationship between the person and the community and it is also and above all from this that being citizens and not subjects passes. For these reasons, the vote of the Democratic Party will obviously be in favour of the ratification in question, but it will above all be a vote of convinced and firm commitment to legislate on these issues and fully implement the Constitution.\",\n",

Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, the measure in question concerns the authorisation to ratify and implement the Convention adopted by the International Labour Organisation on 21 June 2019 with the aim of eliminating violence and harassment in the world of work. The importance of the issue of work is the focus of our political activity. A healthy country is a country that works and, therefore, any attention that can improve the protection of workers in its work environment is an objective to be pursued. The text provides for a comprehensive framework of obligations for Member States, ranging from the adoption of internal provisions defining violence and harassment in accordance with the Convention and requiring employers to take all measures to prevent harmful behaviour, to the more general obligation for States themselves to take the necessary measures, both preventive and punitive. The Convention will then be subject to the monitoring mechanism provided for by the International Labour Organisation, first through periodic reports submitted by States. I therefore wonder, colleagues, whether there is no risk of opening up a new arena of conflict between States, based on judicial struggles, which instead conceal a real desire to attack, at the international level, an unwelcome country or government. It is also necessary to consider the power of complaint which is granted to the Board of Directors of the same Organization and even to individual delegates to the International Labour Conference, making it possible to initiate, on their own initiative, a procedure capable of leading to the creation of a Commission of Inquiry, charged with drawing up a report containing, if necessary, recommendations for the State concerned. Mr President, in conclusion, there are therefore some points of perplexity, which I wanted to express and share with colleagues. As I have already said, we are not opposed to the principles that the Convention promotes, but we have doubts about their translation into practice. Despite these points of uncertainty, given the shared objectives of this Convention, I vote in favour of the League-Salvini Premier Group-Sardinian Action Party.\",\n",
              " \"MAIORINO (M5S). - (IT) Mr President, I must say that when a distant and somewhat confused echo of the great women's movement Me Too reached us here in Italy, the reaction of our country did not make me particularly proud. This impact is staggering to say the least. Sexual harassment, violence and blackmail in the workplace: how many women are victims?It is even difficult to estimate, because there is no specific type of crime and there has never been regular and constant monitoring of this type of violence. To get an idea of this, we have to go back to the only existing Istat survey, which dates back to 2016. The figures are worrying: in fact, 1.404 million women have been physically harassed or sexually blackmailed at work during their working lives. This is one in ten women. On the other hand, 1.173 million, or 7.5%, women have been subjected to some form of sexual blackmail in the course of their working lives in order to get a job, keep a job or advance in their career. Not to mention complaints: only 0.7 per cent of victims of blackmail have reported them to law enforcement. Why, in the face of such a widespread phenomenon, are there so few complaints?For rather obvious reasons: fear of not being believed or even blamed, of losing their job or of all being in vain. Can we blame them?I would say no. Just think of the shocking case last summer when the president of the Lucan transport company, Cotrab, despite being tried and sentenced to two years and six months for sexual violence against an employee, was re-elected by the same consortium. This woman was one of the 0.7 percent of victims who found the courage to report, defied the fear of losing their jobs and not being believed, and faced a lengthy trial. The culprit is convicted, but then everything risks being thwarted by a subculture that normalizes and trivializes sexual violence at work. The episode shows that the current tools are not enough to counter this hateful phenomenon. I feel that I agree with the concern expressed, among others, by the Foundation for the Study of Labour Consultants, which highlights how the devastating effects of the COVID-19 pandemic on women's employment, such as increased job insecurity and the resulting economic and social disadvantage, can contribute to further exacerbating the phenomenon of harassment and especially blackmail in the workplace. I recall that already in 2019, the Commission on Femicide - of which I am honoured to be a member - had dedicated November 25 of that year to combating violence and harassment in the workplace, highlighting how work is a universally recognised right and, nevertheless, work itself still represents a place of inequality between men and women. We therefore welcome the achievement of today's ratification of the ILO Convention, which recognises that violence and harassment constitute a violation or abuse of human rights and recognises the right of everyone to a world of work free from violence and harassment. I would also like to emphasise that the Armed Forces are also a workplace. Women have been part of the Armed Forces for 21 years now, so it is no longer possible to postpone the introduction of the specific offences of violence and sexual harassment, even within the military penal code.\",\n",

In particular, we are voting against it because we are not convinced by Article 1, which - as Senator Alfieri has pointed out - adds a further period to the preamble to the Convention; to be more precise, it adds a new recital.

I would remind you that Italian jurisdiction is sovereign also and above all in matters of fundamental human rights, so we do not accept the principle that it - which, I repeat, is sovereign - must operate under the supervision of the European Court of Justice. We are not convinced by this for a number of reasons, not only constitutional but also political. Ladies and gentlemen, let me remind you, for example, of the recent judgment of the European Court of Human Rights (ECHR) on Article 41a: a very sensitive matter for Italy, because these are measures which have cost the lives of important judges, starting with Falcone and Borsellino.\",\n",

Surprisingly enough, the bill was amended during its passage through the House in the sense that two protocols were provided for in the first passage, whereas today we are ratifying only one.

In any case, I will continue to vote accordingly in this way on such acts.

If we take into account that questions are one of the most important means by which the individual parliamentarian brings to the Minister's attention a problem that has arisen in the territory, in the life of an association, in the life of a person, this gives an idea of the profound disinterest with which the Government has taken over one of the most typical manifestations of parliamentary work. It is not possible for a Member of Parliament to take on the responsibilities of his own territory to bring them to the attention of the Government and the Government does not in any way regard this as a qualifying point for his work. I think many Members know that in London, in Parliament, the Government is required to respond within two weeks.

He was the extreme offspring in Sicily of the Enlightenment; a restless investigator and above all attentive to the recovery of the context, as his favorite author, Alessandro Manzoni, taught him. He had the confidence of the Enlightenment intellectual, the analysis conducted in his own way with a bitter irony; an intention that he knew how to decline in a thousand variations in his works and articles and always aimed at the useful. He was an intellectual of whom today one feels a deep lack and need, far from conformity and from any compromise, as well as scevro from any courtiership.

Talking about the Mafia at a time when its existence was denied and its transformative and mimetic capacity within society was truly an extraordinary insight, considering the time when it was published The Day of the Owl, in 1961. And a few years after that, in 1963, the Anti-Mafia Commission was set up. He spoke of anti-mafia in the late eighties, just when anti-mafia was rising all over Italy. I refer to an article published in Corriere della sera on 10 January 1987, devoted to the relationship between politics, popularity and anti-mafia, in which he explained how anti-mafia can become a formidable tool to make a career, obtain the consent of the public and acquire credits.

From this Sciascia also makes a kind of archaeology, starting from far and precisely from the work of the prefect Mori, sent to Sicily by the fascist Government to solve the issue by military hand, which earned him the advancement of his career. He then came to his days, revealing the danger inherent in the anti-mafia, of which the most serious is to resort to it to have extraordinary powers and momentary suspension of the State of law. For Sciascia the real challenge was to defeat the mafia with ordinary tools, without indulging in authoritarian drift or delusions of omnipotence.

              " 'BOLDRINI (PD). - (IT) Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I should like to draw your attention to an incident of national importance which took place last Thursday in my constituency of Ferrara. Beyond the confidence due to the work of the police, who are investigating to understand whether it is the isolated action of an individual or if it falls into a more complex picture, I think we can not but express not only indignation, but also concern. The letter to the MEIS, even if it was sent by a fool, therefore has a precise meaning; the destination is not random, but precise, as are the offences contained. It must be said that in Ferrara there is a historic Jewish community, perfectly integrated, with which there is a deep, intense and continuous dialogue at all institutional levels. Ferrara is the city where our senator Liliana Segre came, on January 11, 2019, enchanting an audience of 700 students in a crowded theater, telling her experience of surviving Auschwitz. And it is the city where the administration, today led by a legist, wanted to grant her in the same year honorary citizenship, for the deep bond, woven in time. Ferrara is the city of Bassani, the Finzi Contini and the city of MEIS. The letter was sent in the run-up to Remembrance Day, 27 January, a commemoration of the Holocaust victims, in memory of the opening of the gates of Auschwitz on 27 January 1945. Other events have occurred elsewhere: last Sunday the presentation, via Zoom, of the book The Desert Generation by the Roman author Lia Tagliacozzo, an event promoted by the Jewish Studies Center in Turin, was interrupted. Images of Hitler were introduced, insults such as Jews in the ovens, We will burn you all, and I stop here. It is therefore a scientifically organised attack, using new digital tools. It is difficult to think of a coincidence, especially at a time when neo-Nazi impulses are awakening everywhere in Europe. We are witnessing a resurgence of hatred, typical of times of social unrest and unrest, when ideologies take root more easily, because they sink and cement themselves in the dissatisfaction and frustration of people, who are presented with an enemy to encourage their struggle against each other. If Jews have always been - as I said just now - easy targets, the pandemic crisis we are experiencing is fertile ground for cultivating and instilling further fears. I therefore ask for the commitment of all those present to monitor, guard and distance themselves from such incidents, which cannot be robbed as minor, just because they do not have devastating effects, because they are not: among the effects is the risk of emulation they generate. Trust in the police must be accompanied by a constant awareness campaign. I conclude my speech by recalling, duly, the words of the president of the MEIS and the director: The ignominious and cowardly act only increases the determination and tenacity with which the museum leads and will lead the mission assigned to it by the Italian Parliament to keep the memory alive, to fight anti-Semitism and to educate the new generations to the principles of equality and fraternity that our Constitution calls us to pursue.',\n",

These are, in simple terms, fabric parts, foam rubber, shock absorbers and other types of material. National legislation provides for this as a last resort waste, but in other European countries the waste from petroleum processing is kept to a minimum, as it is used as a fuel, for its high energy value. I therefore hope that the same solution can be found in Italy by making landfills useless or reducing their volume. In Verona, a request was submitted to the Veneto Region for the construction of a landfill in Sorgà, De Morta, occupying a total area of 455,000 square metres. The waste will come for 65 percent from a company in Castelnuovo del Garda and for 35 percent from a company in Lainate. The Municipality of Concamarise, in the province of Verona, where I am honoured to serve as mayor, has expressed its no, as reported in the newspaper L'Arena on 11 February 2020.

After some regional politicians and members of parliament from the Democratic Party raised concerns about the project in question, I ask that, together with the rest of the Government, we consider planning at national level.

I say this clearly and with the sense of responsibility I feel towards the country, in simple words and I hope clear: Beware, across Europe there is another strong storm brewing. Angela Merkel was right when she said that the hardest months of the pandemic are ahead. The virus, when more vaccines are authorised and then distributed, will fold, but now it continues to circulate with increasing force and can hit us very hard again.

This week we see a general deterioration in the epidemiological situation in the country: RT, incidence, occupancy rate of intensive care units and outbreaks of unknown origin are increasing at the same time. To be even more precise, I report, albeit in a schematic way, the main data emerged from the last monitoring booth. Let's start with the RT: in the period between December 15 and 28, 2020, after four weeks, the RT rises again and for the first time, after six weeks, it is now above index 1. Even this data, taken individually, clearly indicates that we are very likely at a new phase change: the epidemic is again in an expansive phase. The data tell us that the RT calculated on symptomatic cases is 1.03; 3 regions have a point RT greater than 1 even in the lower value; 6 regions exceed it in the average value; one region reaches it and 3 touch it. The data tell us that the RT calculated on symptomatic cases is 1.03; 3 Regions have a point RT greater than 1 even in the lower value; 6 Regions exceed it in the average value; one Region reaches it and 3 approaches it.

In the last 14 days, we went from 305.47 new cases per 100,000 inhabitants between December 14 and 27 to 313.28 cases in the period from December 21 to January 3. Although the week under assessment was characterised by a lower number of tampons on public holidays, there is again an increase in incidence, which in the country now stands at 166.02 per 100. Although the week under assessment was characterized by a lower number of tampons on public holidays, there is again an increase in incidence, which in the country is now equal to 166.02 per 100,000 inhabitants in a week. As the monitoring booth report shows, the countrywide incidence is therefore still far from levels that would allow case identification and contact tracing to be fully restored throughout the country. As noted in the monitoring cabin report, the incidence across the territory is therefore still far from levels that would allow the full restoration of case identification and contact tracing across the national territory. With a weekly incidence value of 166, we are at a figure 3 times higher than the ceiling of 50 new cases, considered the maximum threshold that can be managed by the territorial health services. With a weekly incidence value of 166, we are 3 times higher than the ceiling of 50 new cases, considered the maximum threshold that can be managed by regional health services. No wonder, then, that the number of new cases not linked to known transmission chains is rising sharply from 31,825 to 40.825 to 40,487.487. The other automatic effect of the increase in the incidence rate is the progressive overload of hospital facilities. The other automatic effect of the increase in the incidence rate is the progressive overload of hospital facilities.

In particular, as regards the occupancy rate in intensive care, it should be noted that, at national level, it is once again above the critical threshold of 30 per cent. The parameters reported above result in a significant change in the risk index assigned to the individual regions: twelve regions and autonomous provinces are at high risk; eight are at moderate risk, two of which are progressing to high risk in the coming weeks, and only one region is currently at low risk.

              " \"Mr. President, Mr. Minister, honourable colleagues, the virus continues to spread rapidly; the emergence of new variants with greater dissemination capacity, even if with unchanged pathogenic action, has simply accelerated this process. We see this simply by observing what happens in other European countries, which in fact alternate measures and phases that are less restrictive with others that push up to total lockdown. Our country, which also experiences the difficulties of regionalization of the national health system as a result of the rules of Title V of the Constitution, in the path of the fight against coronavirus, despite the enormous difficulties involved, has always tried to maintain the right balance between restrictions and concessions, between openings and closings, despite the large problems and repercussions that each measure brought with it. We must never forget, however, a fundamental point that so many citizens demand: the protection of health comes first. The protection of the integrity and life of everyone goes beyond what may be the demands, even just and justified, of some. No one has ever forgotten, in the various measures adopted, the economic, social and complex problematic consequences for so many citizens that they would cause, but always trying to give concrete answers. The political will has always been to protect the most disadvantaged economic groups and the most fragile and vulnerable people in our social state. Unfortunately, a greater elasticity and a reduction in the most restrictive measures is almost a logical consequence of a rapid increase in infections, an acceleration in the spread of the virus and its surge with the rise of the RT index. Increasingly, it is necessary to insist on the continuous awareness and information of citizens, in recalling their sense of citizenship and belonging to the community. If we do not all succeed in this process of maturation and inner processing, we will not be able to eradicate or defeat the virus. Any measure, even the most shared and participated, requires the convinced adherence of every citizen. It's an adherence that for the most part has been and for which we can only thank the Italians. It's important to remember that the rules apply and are fully realized only if each of us understands that, in this pandemic, everyone has to do their part every day, not out of simple obligation or fear of sanctions, but because our responsible behaviour is an indispensable condition in the difficult battle against the coronavirus. Those who govern must know how to sparkle and balance the measures with the right balances. If the virus is so dynamic and changeable in its aggressiveness, even the consequential policy choices cannot be static, but must be balanced and modified in relation to the trend of the pandemic. I would like to highlight two aspects in particular in the architecture of the DPCM that we are analysing. The first relates to the introduction, in the context of the subdivision of the different zones according to the infectivity index recorded, of the so-called white area, which provides for less restrictive measures than the so-called yellow area, always in order to ensure the maximum consistency between the epidemiological scenario applicable to each territory and the degree of rigor of the containment measures applied. This innovation, agreed with the technical-scientific committee, represents and encompasses, at this particular moment, more than anything else, a symbolic value and a message of encouragement to Italians: be more virtuous and attentive you can and you must. The second aspect concerns the lowering of the threshold value of RT infection rates, to enter or pass through the various areas. Certainly, a fundamental support in the management of this pandemic has begun with the administration of vaccines, whose progressive availability will allow us to have a lethal weapon against the virus, starting with those in the front line, such as health workers, and the weakest and most fragile members of the population. The tens of thousands of deaths, the suffering of intensive care, the gaze lost in the void of those who know that they may not make it are a warning to institutions and citizens, to try to do more and better, in the interest of the community. The many required sacrifices, to which so many have adhered, with awareness and conscience, cannot be undone when, despite the many doubts and uncertainties, at the moment when the vaccination campaign has just begun, we finally step into the light, at the bottom of a tunnel.\",\n",
              " 'Mr Minister, I thank you for your communication, which I found reasoned, timely and above all honest. The Government does not hide the sensitivity of the health and economic situation and expresses concern that in the country on the one hand an unjustified feeling of escaped danger may advance and on the other the rejection of new measures to contain the number of infections and, more generally, the circulation of the virus in its different variants, autochthonous and imported. The Government does not hide the sensitivity of the health and economic situation and says it is concerned that the country may advance on the one hand an unjustified feeling of escaped danger and on the other the rejection of new measures aimed at containing the number of infections and, more generally, the circulation of the virus in its different variants, autochthonous and imported. If this is true, we must not hide the fact that today we lack an accurate measurement, a reliable budget, an unambiguous and unassailable account of what has happened on the various fronts of the crisis during the last year. The effort we must make - Parliament, Government, Regions, system of local authorities - is to activate certified and transparent data banks, through which the public can follow the evolution of the pandemic, the measures and effects of the same that the decision-making bodies have taken, are taking and will take. There is therefore an urgent need for a transparent operation on preventive measures such as those listed by the new action that the Government is about to perfect and those related to health care and the ongoing vaccination campaign.

              " \"The authorisation of the Moderna vaccine, alongside that of Pfizer, is good news, but it is not enough: we need a plurality of actors to make the campaign faster, more systematic, fairer and - indeed - more transparent. We need to communicate clearly that the vaccine is the tool to get out of this collective nightmare that affects everyone's lives, relationships, social, work and emotional dynamics, that affects the educational and educational journey of an entire generation, and to deal with it, we need confidence. To generate trust, we need transparency about responsibility and decision-making, about choosing which priorities to give, about safety, about which vaccines to administer and why, about the organizational model, about the exhibition, about the universal dimension of free and universal vaccination for all. It is the absence of this perspective, which still seems elusive, that divides the country into two, between those who are guaranteed and those who are not, between those who have a certain income and those who are denied it by restrictions, between those who are able to exercise their right to study and those who are not. It is the absence of perspective that, despite the goodwill and commitment of the excellent Minister Speranza and the entire Executive, sometimes renders the measures ineffective. It is difficult, in fact, for those who do not share them or feel excluded from them, who once again feel neglected, to apply them willingly and feel involved. In every debate on this subject we have repeated that every decree of the President of the Council of Ministers or decree-law that prohibits or limits economic activities must carry with it immediate financial coverage for refreshments, which in turn must be immediate, without bureaucratic delays or the intermediation of third economic actors, which guarantee the subjects concerned the survival of their economic and working activity and safeguard their dignity as citizens.

To do this, the test needs to be easily accessible, no reservation required, and you also need to be able to use the strengths and resources of, for example, volunteers, the Red Cross and the many associations of volunteer doctors and nurses. I saw some experiences in Milan that I really liked, because there the tampon costs too much, so you also have to make it cost much less. In Lazio - where we are lucky, basically - and in Sicily the price has calmed down. In Lazio - where we are fortunate, basically - and in Sicily the price has calmed down.

I am not saying to calm it down but at least to keep it down, so that it can be accessible and so that it can be an implementation of the right to health care, which you have also spoken about, Mr Minister. This right to healthcare is enshrined in Article 32 of the Constitution and it also sees the possibility for private individuals to make a profit, we would be missing something else. However, be careful: the profit of the private sector must be reasonable, in the circumstances in which we find ourselves, because it cannot be disproportionate and linked to taking advantage of a state of emergency; I therefore ask the Government to act in this regard and to intervene to check and keep the prices of tampons low.

There are many volunteers who would like to do this but find bureaucratic obstacles: in the granting of land, in the ASL and even in the identification of doctors who can do this type of activity. In fact, colleagues, not all doctors can do it, although the one to do with rapid tampons is an absolutely banal and simple activity. Lowering the price and making tampons accessible, so that they become a real social habit, through light custody, without large expenses, perhaps also managed by volunteers of the Red Cross or other associations, is important, so that jointly and not disjointly from vaccination allow us to slow down the speed of spread of the virus.

              " 'You, Mr Minister, are well aware that this virus has exacerbated and widened inequalities, hitting the most vulnerable and disadvantaged people the hardest. Hospitals have been overwhelmed by the epidemic wave, despite the extraordinary commitment of the staff, which I want to emphasize. Several screening and oncology visits have been skipped, and many non-Covid diseases cannot be treated; many people who are not self-sufficient have not been able to access therapies; in particular, those with mental disorders and mental frailty could not be followed. So if we have more doctors, more nurses and more ICU beds compared to a year ago and we have put an additional 12 billion in healthcare, we know that we will need more investment. Closing these gaps and getting the most vulnerable people back into the system must be our first priority. You, Mr Minister, have rightly reminded this House that Covid has only a few months and that with vaccines we will defeat the virus. We must not, therefore, misread this decisive phase. Now, in fact, the most complex moment arrives, that of the mass administration: it is a long and complex work, involving all the institutions and requiring maximum collaboration and a widespread information campaign. The country is ready to increase the number of doses to be administered as soon as the new vaccines are authorised. In this sense and in the light of my reference to the need to protect the most vulnerable, I ask you, Mr Minister, to formalize as soon as possible the commitment made by Commissioner Arcuri on priority vaccinations for people with disabilities and their carers. It would be really important to clarify this aspect once and for all. People with disabilities have suffered more than others from the effects of Covid and have often been left alone. Now it is necessary to protect them, as with all other fragile people. I will conclude by dedicating a few more minutes to an issue which is particularly close to my heart and which is one of the commitments we are asking the Government to make: I am talking about schools. It took the pandemic - I say this without any polemical spirit - to put the school at the centre of the public debate?This will perhaps be one of the few positive aspects that the health crisis will leave us. Our country, like many others, has had to deal with a terrible uncertainty, caused by a completely unprecedented situation. In recent days, nations such as Germany and Britain have deemed necessary the painful decision to close all schools of every order and grade. Every country has had to deal with the difficulty of keeping schools open in a situation where the third wave is no longer just a hypothesis. Schools are places where, despite the great prevention work done and the extraordinary commitment - which I want to emphasize - of school administrators, teaching and non-teaching staff and students, you can still get infected. We must continue to work in synergy with the Regions to enable, in the light of the evolution of the epidemiological picture you have indicated with precise data, the return of as many students as possible to the classroom. It is clear, in fact, that this generation is paying dearly for the lack of adequate classrooms and, even more so, the lack of relationships. Further solutions will be needed, in addition to improved transport and flexible schedules. There will have to be a refreshment for this generation that we can call cognitive and emotional. I am not talking about an economic restructuring, but one that is even more important. Investments, initiatives, school activities for recovery, support for what has been taken away from this generation in these long months, strengthening of services and territorial networks, renewal of teaching, as if distance learning could replace teaching in person, and therefore investments in teachers and their training and services aimed at psychophysical well-being. Now we have to work to preserve the ability of students to get out of this season with as little damage as possible, so I hope that we work to strengthen the tools we have, giving priority to pedagogical and psychological support to students, because, in addition to the serious problem of educational debt that is piling up, the problem of economic and social inequalities has intensified, but there is also - and perhaps most importantly - the emotional discomfort of students who are lost, seeking meaning for their present and future days, because, if we fail to build answers, we are risking the future of the country.',\n",

Have you ever thought that perhaps a one-size-fits-all communication would help everyone?So, medicine is not an exact science.

              " \"STEGER (AUT (SVP-PATT, UV)). Mr President, representatives of the Government, ladies and gentlemen, Italy is off to a good start on vaccines, but as Minister Speranza pointed out, this is a marathon which is won by perfecting not only the supply machine but also the administration. The feeling is that, since the start of the vaccine campaign, many doubters have changed their minds and that the skepticism that floated in some small segments of public opinion is disappearing. This is why we must continue with the approach you have indicated, that of listening and comparison, avoiding clashes between fans, which would have negative consequences from all angles. We are confidently waiting for 29 January, because if the European medicines agency (EMA) authorises the AstraZeneca vaccine, that day we will really see the light at the end of the tunnel and it seems, as the Minister said, that the request for authorisation by Johnson & Johnson for its vaccine, which has the great advantage of requiring a single dose to guarantee full protection, is also imminent. In the meantime, however, we must continue to manage the situation responsibly and with the prudential approach that has always guided the government's decisions. Of course, there have been times when citizens have found it difficult to understand some decisions, especially when the cards were changed at the last moment, when there was no linearity in communications or when some measures did not seem to meet a proportionality criterion. Despite this, we believe that overall the regional differentiation model has worked and that above all it is adequate to face the phase that awaits us, a phase, that is, when infections do not decrease, there is the unknown of the virus variants, there is the risk that the second wave will be grafted onto the third one immediately, as is happening in other countries. A new wave would jeopardize the vaccination campaign and we absolutely cannot afford this. So the new measures are fine, but only if the restrictions increase and the aid must be increased. Ten months have passed since the first closures, an unsustainable time for most businesses and businesses who are now fighting their battle for survival. So, immediately after the budget displacement, immediately after that white tax year for the self-employed, immediately after compensation to take into account the loss of turnover, immediately after the tax files for small and medium-sized enterprises, which in recent months have not been able to work or have been able to work only to a limited extent. At the same time, Mr Minister, the experience of recent months suggests that certain derogations from specific contexts or situations are necessary and do not in any way represent a danger. This is particularly true in mountainous areas, where the closure of ski lifts is also becoming a problem for the police and hence for the security of the area. Managers should be given the opportunity to open the ski lifts, which without tourism and without travel between the regions would only have the effect of distributing even better the people who climb mountains for motor activities and individual sports and who today, with the ski lifts closed, tend to concentrate in certain areas. It is a matter of making outdoor activities even safer, with people spread over a radius of hundreds of metres, much less dangerous than shopping in a shopping centre or a Saturday afternoon in the streets of the city's shopping centre. Instead, let us treasure what we have learned in these months and what we see every day in our territories, let us promote those individual and collective behaviours that do not pose a risk and that make people's lives less strenuous and above all let us accompany these new measures with an unprecedented commitment to the economy and to the vaccination campaign, which is the most important battle, the one that will lead us out of this tragic experience.\",\n",
              " \"PARENTE (IV-PSI). Mr. President, ladies and gentlemen, the Viva Italia - Socialist Party Group will vote yes to the majority resolution. This is the time of responsibility in the face of the pandemic, but Minister, let this resolution really be a starting point to rebuild healthcare and not navigate by sight as too many times the virus has forced us to do. Health can and should be the highest form of democracy and equality, without any difference in age, gender, territory, health status and income. This is the ideal that is shaped by the National Health Service which you have said many times that you want to defend, and rightly so. But too much inequality and too much falsehood still circulates. Let's think about science. You said it right that science is our beacon. How many falsehoods are still going around about vaccines, that would not be safe because the very short time available to get a vaccine would have jumped the steps?This is not true because the phases have been carried out simultaneously by researchers from all over the world. In the Commission we are carrying out a very important investigation, consulting the leading Italian experts who reassure us on this point. Mr Minister, we must implement transparent institutional and policy information and ensure continuous updating to take our citizens by the hand. As far as traceability is concerned, I do not know how many times I have said that we have tabled amendments, because there is no national plan on tampons. As Mr De Falco said very well before, it is the cost and accessibility of tampons that are the biggest differences between territories and regions. You, Mr Minister, have called for unity, which must be practiced through dialogue, also in Parliament, and this is where we must start if we really want to defend health. As for schools, there is an important proposal. Tuscany has taken a number of measures, from transport, to tutors who go to bus stops and help children keep their distance (the project is called Ti accompagno). We ask Minister Azzolina to take this initiative as a national experiment. What do we need?We cannot, after a year, be at the same level as last March. We have to get out of this lockdown. Vaccines will protect us, but we have to defend vaccines. How do we defend them?With rules, which we always ask our citizens to respect, and, for example, with a protocol for workers. Mr. Minister, let us not always be overwhelmed by problems without anticipating and addressing them. In the newspapers we read about the issue of dismissals of workers who do not want to be vaccinated. Mr. Minister, call the social partners together and we renew the protocol of 24 April last on work environments, which has allowed infections not to be so widespread in the workplace, and we discuss the specifics of different jobs together with the social partners. Vaccinations for the elderly should be done in the places closest to them. Therefore, we do not think that the elderly can be called by the ASL to go to who knows where to get vaccinated. We immediately involve general practitioners. Speaking of proximity, you appropriately set up a Commission chaired by Monsignor Paglia on the question of the review of RSA. We must move quickly on this aspect too, moving beyond the RSA model and promoting home-based integrated medicine especially for the elderly. I always hope that the Parliament can also talk about ESM resources, because this is the issue that needs to be addressed. I repeat, we are making a big plan for home care for the elderly. Moreover, it is not possible that in a pandemic situation there are still precarious people in the Agenas, among doctors, healthcare staff and social workers. We see this pandemic as a tremendous opportunity to have zero precariousness in health and social services. I personally proposed the establishment of a national health guard as we need to prepare for any other pandemics. We therefore need flexibility (and not just building facilities and intensive therapies) and ongoing training of health personnel and also volunteers who are periodically trained to respond to emergencies. Health, in fact, must cease to be culturally relevant to the sick, but must be protected and defended by those who are healthy. We must therefore focus on primary and secondary prevention, home care, digitization and local medicine. In the Health Committee we recently unanimously approved a resolution that talks about resuming care for non-Covid patients (for example oncological and cardiopathic), because it is absurd that they are neglected. With these figures, Mr Minister, and with the data you have brought with you regarding the fact that hospitals are filling up, we cannot afford to abandon more patients; therefore we must absolutely act in this direction. Mr Minister, colleagues, we must recover the beauty of everyday life, because our lives are turned upside down. For those who believe, the Pope on Sunday made a beautiful speech on the meaning of the baptism of Jesus. Jesus came among us to be close to us and to take up our daily lives. She called for unity and I appeal to her: to take up the daily life, the beauty of the daily life of our fellow citizens, we must first set an example. Let us take up the daily relationship between the Government and Parliament, even with the opposition, in a fruitful and productive dialectic for the good of the country.\",\n",

Should you be proud of the record number of GDP losses compared to all other European countries?Minister, these two parameters that I gave you (records of deaths and records of decrease in GDP) are actually the result of the exam that we - for us I mean the Italians and not the parliamentarians - almost a year after the start of the emergency are forced to do in relation to the action of this Government. With regard to the two main lines of action which the Government should have taken as a matter of great priority - I refer, on the one hand, to measures to contain health and, on the other, to measures to restrict and deprive the freedom of enterprise and individuals - we have seen you engaged only on the second, that is, on restricting. Minister, before I tell you the vote, I tell you what has not been done in the field of health containment: no tests have been done. Last Monday, we made 90,000 tampons; in England, we made 500. I would like to ask the Commissioner whether he is prepared to accept the amendments tabled by the Committee on the Environment, Public Health and Consumer Protection. We've been saying for months that, since the tracking system has been broken, and this is unfortunately a fact - that tampons, even quick ones, are used to identify people who are carriers of the virus without symptoms. It's such a trivial thing to do, doing it in such large numbers, that you don't understand what you're doing with this virus mapping. You haven't made home care protocols for general practitioners.

In conclusion, Minister, with respect to all this, I suggest that it is not the numbers I have listed, which alone say and certify the failure of what you have done; it is not Renzi who sends you home, as we have now understood; it is not even Covid who sends you home: it is the Italians who can no longer and will send you home as soon as they are given the opportunity to do so.',\n",
              " \"ERRANI (Misto-LeU). - (IT) Mr President, we thank the Minister, especially after his speech in this House today, for the work he is doing. It's not an easy job. There are many masters of commentary, but I challenge anyone to prove that in such a dramatic story there are those who already have the answers. I should like to ask you to be cautious. Even a description of reality in which it is said that nothing has been done, zero, that there are no results, that everything has to be done over again, in Bartali, does not do honour, in my opinion, even to the opposition, because you know very well that this is not the case. I would like to try to point out three things that we should all be thinking about. It is clear that vaccines open up a new condition, a positive outlook. In this regard, the comments made in the early days of the start of the vaccination campaign proved to be imprecise, to put it mildly. All the comments said that we had already failed the vaccination campaign, but the results so far are positive. Vaccination is a difficult and very complicated process. It is one thing to vaccinate, for example, healthcare workers and those working in RSAs, but it is another thing to vaccinate the masses to achieve herd immunity. And then - as has been rightly said - certain public functions require consistency: if an operator of a RSA decides not to vaccinate, it is legitimate, but he must choose not to operate in those structures anymore. I say this not to make an ideological controversy, but for a problem that - as we have seen - is very concrete. Mr. Minister, I think it is right to support all efforts at transparency on the issue of vaccines to allow even those who are not in the majority who support this Government to have all the elements and data at their disposal to use and interpret them. Let's make an extra effort, because at least on the issue of vaccines we could not say find a formal unity, but support a common commitment to achieve a result for all. The second point concerns the pandemic. I want to make a little personal observation that doesn't involve anyone. The data is growing, and there's no question about that. There is no point in continuing, depending on the position, to call for the opening or closing of businesses. Clearly, if countries such as Britain, Germany and the Netherlands - practically the whole of Europe - are further tightening the rules, there must be a reason. Can we say that it is the government's responsibility if the pandemic data is growing?No: if we look anywhere in Europe and the world, the data tells us that this is not the case. I say very clearly that, for the Christmas holidays, I was for a stricter solution; I understand all the problems, but I was for a stricter solution, because this is the only way today to reduce the growth of the pandemic. And I'm not the only one saying this, but - as you know - Fontana and Zaia have said it, because it's an objective fact, and we should therefore avoid fighting about it. We need a shift of 24 billion and we could work on another very important aspect - of course, if we start working on the merits and not on accusations, counter-accusations and controversies - and that is on building a restaurant system based on turnover and the tax mechanism. I make this argument, primarily aimed at the opposition, because I believe that the most critical elements are health and economic confusion and uncertainty. This is the effort that is required of us: an effort that is not of political positioning, but of opening a new phase in the country. You, the Minister, have always been consistent and have always come to this House, but what I fear most are the ritualistic assembly meetings in which they always say the same things and we fail to make a step forward. It is all very well to think about this, but let us take a few steps forward. From this discussion comes the message about the need for vaccinations and I appreciate what the opposition has said in this regard: no one is against vaccination. From this point of view, Minister, I personally think talking about white areas is a message. I 'm sorry .\",\n",

But isn't it our job to give this message to the country?But isn't it our job to give this message to the country? When we all talk about the great appreciation for the speech of the President of the Republic, what do we say?When we all say how much we appreciate the President's speech, what are we saying?We have to be consistent. We must be consistent.

Mr Minister, we have also heard about your new agreement with general practitioners: very good, because they are our first interlocutors, so if they too have the opportunity to be vaccinated and to vaccinate, let us add additional forces. And I also think of military healthcare as the Red Cross: welcome anyone who can help, because time is of the essence. And why is it?And why is that? We've heard about the virus mutations that are coming, and fortunately today Pfizer said that the vaccine also covers the British and South African variants.

The future lies in feeling like brothers and not in wanting to dominate, said Pope Francis, and the image of the Holy Father in an empty St. Peter's Square immediately comes to mind; an image that goes hand in hand with that of our President of the Republic, when he said that we must be builders and represent the country: fortunately - I must say - there are them, the great sages.

First of all, Mr Zaffini said that in Europe we did everything wrong. I say that it is not at all so, as the scientists we have heard from in the Commission have also acknowledged. To the specific question about what we did wrong, they said: what could people do who didn't know which way to go. So it was done very well; obviously corrections needed to be made, but we didn't know what to expect. So it was done very well; obviously we need to make corrections, but we didn't know what to expect. So I have to say that, both in terms of the vaccination campaign that we are facing, and also in terms of what has been done before in the emergency, we have all tried. Other European countries are no better off than we are. As we know, we are now among the first regions in Europe to vaccinate, so we can also address this emergency.

In all this, the fastest possible administration of the vaccine can allow us to return to normalcy in a short time, so it is right to immunize all health workers - as has been said, they are those who face the virus in the front row - as well as the weaker categories, arriving - as the National Vaccine Plan says very well - to vaccinate other categories, planning to anticipate the vaccination for teachers to promote the reopening of schools, which Senator I spoke very well about earlier, as many other colleagues have done.

While it is true that we need to get people out of hospitals and lighten our healthcare facilities, we believe that school is another fundamental and important factor. It is really about the health of our young people, including the mental discomfort they are experiencing right now. It is therefore a question of finding an adaptive strategy for pandemic planning and vaccination. Professor Brusaferro said that it will be necessary to assess situations and vaccinate in case of outbreaks. I am also thinking of other sectors, starting with transport, which must not only be reorganised; we must also think of transport operators, as well as the prison staff themselves, who are helping us at this time. I am also thinking of other sectors, starting with transport, which must not only be reorganised; we must also think of transport operators, as well as the prison staff themselves, who are helping us at this time. It is therefore - I repeat - a question of adapting in a flexible way what is a plan that we all know and which is very important to follow. Mr Minister, I would add that citizens are now very, very tested, and I am also thinking of their mental health, which I have just mentioned when I speak of young people. It is also important to address this aspect, which is not insignificant, because the psychological health of individuals is the psychological health of society as a whole, which is essential for maintaining it. As I feel and as I think we all see, people are starting to feel some resentment about what is happening. It is therefore essential that attention is also paid to psychological health, an important aspect which I therefore ask you to take into account.

Mr. Minister, we once again give you confidence by voting in favour of the motion for a resolution that we have tabled. Mr President, we are voting in favour of the motion for a resolution which we have tabled.

As for the geographical indications for which coexistence with trademarks already registered in Canada was envisaged (in particular, Parmigiano Reggiano, three Italian hams and three our cheeses), this solution, chosen to protect the rights acquired by local operators, has nevertheless allowed the protection of some European products previously considered generic names, as well as allowing the marketing of some products, in particular Parma ham. As regards the geographical indications for which coexistence with trademarks already registered in Canada was envisaged (in particular, Parmigiano Reggiano, three Italian hams and three our cheeses), this solution, chosen to protect the rights acquired by local operators, nevertheless allowed the protection of certain European products previously considered generic names, as well as allowing the marketing of certain products, in particular Parma ham.

The latter, before CETA, could not be placed on the Canadian market with its name, but only as  original ham, given the existence of a trademark  Parma registered forty years earlier. In addition, the Agreement contains specific provisions against Italian sounding, such as the prohibition of evocation for non-originating products (i.e. the prohibition of the use of symbols, photos, colours and the like which may evoke the origin of the geographical indication), the obligation to indicate the origin on the label in a clear and visible manner, the obligation to further differentiate for products introduced on the market after a certain date, which must bear the indication of  use/imitation  style and so on, as well as the possibility of administrative recourse by the proprietors of individual intellectual property rights of geographical indications. Furthermore, the Agreement contains specific provisions against Italian sounding, such as the prohibition of evocation for non-originating products (i.e. the prohibition on the use of symbols, photographs, colours and the like which may evoke the origin of the geographical indication), the obligation to indicate the origin on the label in a clear and visible manner, the obligation for further differentiation for products placed on the market after a certain date, which must bear the words  style/imitation  and so on, and the possibility of administrative recourse by holders of intellectual property rights in individual geographical indications. In the light of the foregoing, therefore, and with reference to the further point made by the applicant concerning the timing of imports into the European Union of products bearing the designation Parmesan originating in Canada, it is clear that European legislation expressly prohibits their marketing, since the term Parmesan is not generic but is an evocation of the designation Parmigiano Reggiano and as such cannot be used in the European Union for cheeses which do not comply with the specifications of the Italian PDO. Import cases which infringe the exclusive right in the Union of the PDO Parmigiano Reggiano and its synonyms may be reported to the competent authorities of the Member States - in the case of Italy, it is the Central Authority for the Protection of Food Quality and the Suppression of Agricultural Fraud (RFICQ) and the Ministry of Agricultural Policy, in accordance with the Uniform Rules.

Finally, in relation to the issue of product protection on the Italian market and compliance with consumer protection labelling requirements, I would point out that the provision of clear, understandable and legible information on consumer food - a matter harmonised at European level, where EU Regulation 1169/2011 ensures a high level of consumer protection, regulating all aspects of labelling - is of the utmost importance and commitment for this Ministry. This is evidenced, for example, by the letter signed jointly last March by Minister Bellanova and Minister of Economic Development Stefano Patuanelli, sent to the European Commissioners for Health and Agriculture, in which Italy requested that the obligation of origin on the label be extended to all foodstuffs, starting with a quick choice on these products, which have already been tested for years on raw materials such as processed milk, pasta, tomatoes, rice, caramelized rice. This is evidenced, for example, by the letter signed jointly by Minister Bellanova and Minister of Economic Development Stefano Patuanelli last March, sent to the European Commissioners for Health and Agriculture, in which Italy requested that the obligation of origin of the raw materials on the label be extended to all foods, starting with a quick choice on products on which it has already experimented in recent years such as milk, cheeses, processed meats, pasta, rice, tomato derivatives. With this in mind, the Ministers have notified Brussels of the extension until 31 December 2021 of the Decree of 9 December 2016 on milk and cheeses and have then signed the Ministerial Decree of 1 April 2020, which also extends the mandatory provisions of indication of origin, on the label, of durum wheat for durum wheat germ paste, rice and tomato derivatives until 31 December 2021. This is in the belief that in the Farm fork to strategy the mandatory origin must be a central theme, precisely because since that phrase translates from the mandatory field to ta, the origin best explains this interpretation, so that in the label the consumer has the perception of the origin or path of traceability. This is in the belief that in the Farm to Fork strategy the compulsory origin must be a central theme, precisely because since that phrase translates from the field to the table, the compulsory origin best declines this need, so that in the label the consumer has the perception of the entire traceability path. As for the control activities, with specific reference to the one set up by the Central Inspectorate for the Protection of Quality and Fraud Prevention of Agri-Food Products (ICQRF), the latter pays the utmost attention to the verification of the indication of origin reported on agri-food products. This is also done through sample checks of traceability, to ascertain its veracity, to counter the phenomenon of Italian sounding, to protect made in Italy and the most representative productions in this area, with particular reference to those protected by specific legislation of the European Union (PDO and PGI products). Through the assistance and cooperation systems between competent authorities of the Member States of the European Union Administrative assistance and cooperation system (AAC) and Food fraud network (FF), of which the ICQRF is the contact point for Italy together with the Ministry of Health, the reports exchanged with the authorities of other Member States concerning irregularities found on labelling devices are processed. The Administrative assistance and cooperation system (AAC) and the Food Fraud Network (FF), of which the ICQRF is the contact point for Italy together with the Ministry of Health, handle the reports exchanged with the authorities of other Member States concerning irregularities detected on labelling devices. Specific memoranda of understanding have also been signed with the main online trading platforms (eBay, Amazon, Alibaba) on web-based trade, strengthening the protection of consumers using these e-commerce platforms, as well as the promotion, promotion and information on Italian PDO and PGI products, so that the phenomena of misappropriation of Italian quality designations registered on the online market are counteracted. Specific Memoranda of Understanding have also been signed with the main online trading platforms (eBay, Amazon, Alibaba) on web commerce, strengthening the protection of consumers using these e-commerce platforms, as well as the promotion, promotion and information on Italian PDO and PGI products, in order to counter the phenomena of usurpation of Italian registered quality names on the online market. In response to the questions raised by the questioner as to whether Italy's ratification of CETA - instead of representing an opportunity for our country - would, on the contrary, become a vehicle for facilitating the importation of agri-food products with lower safety standards than those in Europe, I reply by pointing out that all agri-food products coming from Canada will have to comply with European sanitary and phytosanitary legislation, including the rules governing access to genetically modified organisms and products. Similarly, due to the precautionary principle - which is enshrined in Article 191 of the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union (TFEU) and is binding and cannot be amended or repealed by any international agreement, including CETA - and sanitary and phytosanitary legislation, products treated with substances that are banned as harmful (at present, the use of glyphosate is still authorised in the European Union) or for which there is no scientific evidence of harm but a suspected risk to human health, will not be able to enter the internal market of the European Union. Therefore, while the precautionary principle remains valid, the European Union will continue to apply its legislation on the prohibition of hormones in livestock, as provided for in Directive 96/22/EC, as amended by Directive 2003/74/EC. In addition, the import of untreated meat from third countries using hormones in livestock for their internal market is only possible if the segregation of farms is ensured, which also applies to the use of antibiotics banned in the European Union, as provided for in Directive 96/23/EC. In addition, the import of untreated meat from third countries that use livestock hormones for their internal market is only possible if livestock segregation is ensured, a principle which also applies to the use of antibiotics banned in the European Union, as provided for in Directive 96/23/EC. This principle was clearly reaffirmed in the declarations annexed to the European Council procedure for the adoption of the decision authorising the signature of CETA on behalf of the Union. This principle has been clearly reaffirmed in the declarations annexed to the procedure of the European Council for the adoption of the decision authorising the signature of CETA on behalf of the Union. Finally, while specifically addressing the issue of GMOs, it should be recalled that, with the implementation of Directive 2015/412/EU, the definitive ban on the cultivation of all varieties of MON810 maize in Italy (Commission Decision No. Finally, while specifically addressing the issue of GMOs, it should be recalled that the implementation of Directive 2015/412/EU has resulted in a definitive ban on the cultivation of all MON810 maize varieties in Italy (Commission Decision No 321 of 3 March 2016) and on all GM maize still being authorised for placing on the market.321 of 3 March 2016) and of all transgenic maize still being authorised for placing on the market. The cultivation of such transgenic maize, whether authorised or authorised, shall be punishable by the penalties provided for in Article 35a of Legislative Decree No. The cultivation of such GM maize, authorised or in the process of being authorised, shall be punishable by the penalties provided for in Article 35a of Legislative Decree No 224 of 8 July 2003.224. To date, no new marketing authorisation applications have been submitted for the cultivation of new GMOs, either for maize or other species. To date, no new applications for marketing authorisation have been submitted for the cultivation of new GMOs, whether for maize or other species. The current legislative system therefore allows action on all new GMOs for which a European cultivation authorisation is applied for, while at the same time the sanctioning system is able to punish all possible cases of infringement of the rules in force. Therefore, the current legislative system enables action to be taken on all new GMOs for which a European cultivation authorisation is requested, while at the same time the sanctioning system is able to punish all possible cases of infringement of the rules in force. As regards the legislation on labelling systems for food and feed containing genetically modified organisms, it is recalled that products, whether food or feed, consisting of, containing or derived from GMOs, are subject to the labelling and traceability requirements laid down in Community Regulations (EC) No 1829/2003 and (EC) No 1829/2003. This Regulation shall enter into force on the twentieth day following that of its publication in the Official Journal of the European Union.1830/2003. This ensures that information is provided to consumers and users of these products, enabling them to make an informed choice. This ensures that information is provided to consumers and users of such products, enabling them to make an informed choice. Regulation (EC) No 1829/2003 provides that foods derived from GMOs intended for the final consumer or food suppliers to the public are to be labelled with the statement on the presence of GMOs. Regulation (EC) No 1829/2003 provides that food derived from GMOs intended for the final consumer or food suppliers must bear on the label the statement on the presence of GMOs. In addition, Regulation No 1830 of 2003 also requires genetically modified food to comply with the requirements on traceability, defined as the ability to trace GMOs and products derived from GMOs at all stages from placing on the market through the production and distribution chain. To ensure traceability, operators handling products containing, consisting of or produced from GMOs are required to provide specific information to the subsequent operator in the chain at all stages of production and distribution. In order to ensure traceability, operators dealing with products containing, consisting of or produced from GMOs are required to provide specific information to the subsequent operator in the chain at all stages of production and distribution.

Mr President, I would like to make it clear that we in the Fratelli d'Italia are interested in treaties - and in this case this international treaty - which protect the Italian producer and consumer first and foremost. We expect from those who govern, independently of the Government and hoping that soon there will be a centre-right Government in Italy, the utmost commitment to defend the name and quality of our products, which are the best in the world. We demand that the government of any country should confront those who try to imitate our valuable products with similar products - you mentioned Parmesan several times - which have nothing to do with ours, but which in some way deceive consumers and threaten the economic and productive system of the country. We have been fighting for many years for the products that end up on our tables to be labelled and also traceable, as you said, so that they can be traced back to their origins and ingredients before they can become food. We, as a parliamentary group and as a party with our leader, Giorgia Meloni, will always keep our eyes peeled before any agreement - in this case CETA, an international agreement with Canada - because first and foremost we want Italy, our economy and our production system. I would like to thank you for your answer, even if we are not satisfied, also because, as I said in the preamble, the deadline has passed and the Government can no longer do anything because it has completely collapsed.

              " \"Mr President, Senator Binetti, together with other colleagues, is asking what initiatives are to be taken to safeguard the activities and functions of the Italian Youth Hotels Association and to support tourism among the most disadvantaged groups, in particular young people. According to its statutes, the AIG (Italian Youth Hotels Association), established by an act of 19 December 1945, is a national non-profit-making social welfare body. The association's institutional purpose is the promotion of youth through the establishment and management of youth hostels and the implementation of all other initiatives to promote the moral, cultural and physical improvement of young people through the practice of tourism, which is regarded as an irreplaceable means of promoting social and mutual knowledge among young people.\",\n",

In addition, the appointment of an extraordinary commissioner was envisaged for the purpose of adjusting the statutes and to allow the orderly transfer of assets and functions to the new entity, as well as for the definition of the outstanding reports at the head of the AIG. The costs that the State would have incurred from 2020 would have amounted to 1.7 million euros per year.

With all due respect and thanks to Undersecretary L'Abbate for his presence in this House and for the kindness with which he answered, even if unsatisfactory, the questions put, I would like to point out that I personally would have expected the presence of Minister Franceschini, that is, the Minister who has a delegation for tourism, or the Minister who has somehow a delegation for youth. For goodness sake, agriculture is always good, but it is certainly not the heart of the problem. What we are experiencing is one of the most dramatic economic and health emergencies that the country has ever experienced - it is said - since the end of World War II and we are facing a situation where we have all tourism stuck, with a dry loss that will mean that it will be years before the sector can be restarted. What we are experiencing is one of the most dramatic economic and health emergencies that the country has ever experienced - it is said - since the end of the Second World War and we are facing a situation in which we have all tourism blocked, with a dry loss that will make it take years before the sector can be put back into motion. However, within the framework of this tourism that we could define as non-profit, a service tourism, we have youth tourism, that is, the availability that allows a young person to broaden cultural horizons and also the social perspective, through this movement activity that allows Italian young people to have the experience of going abroad and those who come from abroad to come to Italy. It is obvious that in the lockdown, just as we are all locked in - and the next decree of the President of the Council of Ministers represents a further limitation on what we might call individual freedoms - we are depriving our young people of school attendance, of cultural experiences, even of deepening, those related to university life and internships, and in this case also of that capacity to broaden horizons. Let us not forget, however, that in the sixties the youth hostels themselves - and this is not an indifferent element - changed from the original designation of moral institutions to that of welfare institutions, because it seemed almost as if it were necessary to assist in some way from the economic and organizational point of view young people in their movements, then to the current one of cultural institutions. We are, therefore, once again considering the world of young people in the worst possible way, that is, not considering it. Clearly the answer and even the speech of my predecessor seems almost to look with greater interest at the guarantee of jobs, but we know that this guarantee is hanging by a thread, which we could call at the moment the famous thread of the integrated fund and which will be subject to the cut of 30 March, when the ban on redundancies will be lifted. It is clear that the answer and also the speech of the colleague who preceded me seem almost to look with greater interest at the guarantee of jobs, but we know that this guarantee is hanging by a thread, which we could call at the moment the famous thread of the integrated fund and which will in any case be subject to the cut of 30 March, when the ban on dismissals will be lifted. We are facing a political attitude capable of turning over to this sector the blindness of a country that does not consider tourism its real black gold. The example of tourism as the black gold of the country is an example that was made by Minister Franceschini, Minister for two legislatures. Now we do not know what will happen in the next Government: maybe Minister Franceschini will become the Head of Government and maybe, if so, he will give tourism and culture a much greater importance than it has been until now, but we know that this kind of black gold, which is Italian tourism, has never been able to be taken into account as the country's own wealth, an economic wealth, an enogastronomic wealth - and this certainly also concerns his skills - a cultural wealth that is tradition, but also the ability to look ahead. Now we do not know what will happen in the next Government: perhaps Minister Franceschini will become the Head of Government and maybe, if so, he will give tourism and culture a much greater importance than he has until now, but we know that this kind of black gold, which is Italian tourism, has never been able to be properly considered as the country's own wealth, an economic wealth, a wine and gastronomic wealth - and this certainly also concerns his skills - a cultural wealth that is made of tradition, but also of the ability to look forward. I think it is ridiculous today to ask this question about youth hotels: when the colleague put his question, as you know, there was still no pandemic, when I put mine we were in the phase of broadening the horizons, in the perspective of returning to a potential normality, while today we are sinking into a dramatic black hole from which we do not even know when and how we will be able to get out, given the impossibility of moving from one municipality to another or from one region to another. This means serious myopia of government, from a cultural, economic, social and organizational point of view, and it means blindness to the rights of the new generations. Other than the recovery plan as a right of the next generation! This is really blindness. This is really blindness. I can only take this moment to say that we hope that some good can come from evil.

On the same day, the excellent journalist Claudia Procentese published a post on her Facebook page, through which, with absolutely talking images, the national community came to know about this demolition, carried out in a few hours on the same day, then again on July 9 last year, so much so that then, as the Undersecretary said, the superlocation of the Superintendence for the metropolitan area of Naples is July 13.19 of 2009, the so-called house plan, which in Campania allows reconstructions even with increased cubature, where there is no prohibition with respect to any prescriptions of the Superintendence. Forgive me the expression, but the Ministry can not \"get away\" by claiming that the building was not protected. However, before deciding its fate, the Superintendence or the Municipality (a territorial body) would have had to initiate the procedure of verification of the cultural interest. This was neither done nor requested. The Superintendence claims to have been aware of what was happening at the time of the demolition, however, it admits that eighteen months earlier, i.e. in January 2019, based on a request from the previous October, it had answered a question about the binding situation by the notary in charge of the firm that carried out the demolition. This should have been an alarm bell, such as to simply induce the Superintendence, or someone inside it - we are talking about this, not street people - to make a phone call to the Municipality of Giugliano to know if it had given or was going to give the permission to demolish a historic building, on which there was no explicit constraint, but which certainly, being eighteenth century, had exceeded seventy years, so it was protected ex lege. There was then an involuntary complicity in turning the gaze the other way and we lost an important piece of the history of the territory. The associations Italia Nostra and Architetti in rete (AIR) have made a proposal for the acquisition of an item within the current General Regulatory Plan (GRP) for the protection of historic rural buildings. This is a countrywide problem. A national strategy for the protection of historic rural building heritage is needed. I am not talking about the historic centres and the proposal for protection of the Association Bianchi Bandinelli, because it would take much more time; however, throughout the country we are really in a very high danger condition, that is, we risk every day to lose all the Renaissance and modern buildings (thousands of buildings, which are our history and our territory) and to lose the context in which it is inserted.',\n",

On the contrary, over 35,000 volumes - they are the most recent part of the library itself - and the papers, therefore the professor's archive, will be donated by the family to the State, but they will go to Bologna, and therefore not to Milan.

              " 'At the beginning of this experience of government - on 9 September 2019 - I foreshadowed, precisely in this Chamber, a clear political project for the country. I immediately made it clear that the programme on which I was going to ask Parliament for confidence did not and could not be resolved in a mere list of heterogeneous proposals, nor, even less, in a sterile summary of the positions taken by each of the political forces that would have supported the majority. Already then I was aware that an alliance between political formations from different histories, traditions, experiences and cultures, which - in addition - had also been completely opposed, sometimes even in a very harsh way, in the most recent international scenario, could only arise on the basis of two fundamental differences: the European leadership, not only extrinsically interdependent, but also a convinced anchorage between the values of the Italian people - a way of recovering the role of the protagonist, even in the geopolitical and geopolitical context, in the European Union - and of making it possible to return to the role of the protagonist, in the first place, as the main protagonist, and in the second place, as a means of protecting the European identity, in the context of the European Union. From the moment the programme was drawn up, in which I myself participated, together with the delegations of the majority political forces, we all worked together to ensure that the perspective of a broad and courageous reform project was drawn up. I said then that this political project would mark the beginning of a new - which we all hoped for and still hope for - reform season, aimed at building a fairer and more inclusive society, able to combine the primary objective of economic growth, revitalisation and modernisation with the essential requirements of sustainability, social and territorial cohesion, in the context of the full development of the person. At the beginning of 2020, the conditions for the implementation of that project were measured, unfortunately, with the hurricane of the pandemic; it was and is a hurricane that has upset and is profoundly upsetting our society, our lifestyle habits, our collective destiny. The pandemic has forced us to redefine our priorities, to rethink our development model, the very dynamics of our relations. We are facing a challenge of epochal scope, we are measuring ourselves with the need to define the reconstructive lines of a society that is marked anew (seems to be a re-raining in the past) by primordial fears, often known precisely for generations of the past, as well as the risk of losing essential bonds between health, life and well-being, all of which are deeply fragile. Some of our deep-rooted convictions have suddenly been called into question. Politics itself has been forced to confront, almost daily, perhaps as never before, science and technology in the difficulty of providing effective and rapid responses to an overwhelming health emergency and a severe economic recession. Even our most established legal knowledge has been severely challenged. The state of emergency has forced us to introduce, first in the West, with all the doubts, perplexities and difficulties, and of course soon afterwards in all the other countries, restrictive measures of human rights, making very delicate and laborious balances between constitutional principles and rights. In these dramatic months, even in the face of unprecedented complexity, this majority has managed to demonstrate great responsibility, achieving, with some difficulty, convergences of views and resolutions of action, as was required especially in the most critical stages. We have cultivated a constant and close dialogue with all the institutional levels of our system, from the regional authorities to those of the municipalities, in the awareness that only by practicing regularly, in an unconventional way, the principle of cooperation, it would be possible to pursue the strategies that are considered to be effective in this area, especially in the areas of health. Not only that; the experience of the pandemic has strengthened in the political forces, which have loyally supported the Government, the awareness of the value of dialogue and dialectical confrontation between even distant positions, which is an inescapable premise to make the most correct choices, to make those superior syntheses in the highest collective interest, to take the fundamental decisions from which, due to the gravity of the hour, we could not escape. Everyone on the spot will express their opinions; we are in the field of the opinable. For my part, I can say that the Government has operated the delicate balances and constitutional interests involved from time to time with the utmost scruple and with the utmost care, in the awareness of the immense consequences that would have occurred in the lives of individuals and for the future of our community. If today, to you who are in this Chamber and to the citizens who follow us from home, I can speak with a high head, it is not because of the arrogance of those who believe that they have never made a mistake, but because of the awareness that, together with the entire government team, they have committed all their physical and intellectual energies, to offer the best possible protection to the national community.',\n",
              " 'Over the past few months, there has been a thick political debate about the role of politics, which we have all been questioning. In fact, politics has never been called upon to fulfill its noblest mission, that of making choices for the common good, some of which have tragic consequences. It was a political choice to give priority to protecting health - and this was an intuition and a conviction that immediately took root in the Government - not only as a fundamental right of the person and the primary interest of the community, but also in the awareness that, only by protecting that primary good, one could - and can - preserve the productive fabric of the country.',\n",
              " 'The whole policy, then, has been the choice to allocate, even through repeated and progressive budgetary diversions, large resources - over EUR 100 billion in net debt - to support workers, enterprises, families and fragile groups, with some correlation to the losses suffered, even if, as I said yesterday, I did not want and do not intend to say that these are sufficient to fully compensate for the losses suffered.',\n",

Even in the most complex moments of the health and economic emergency, in fact, we never gave up laying the foundations for the revival of the country. I recall, for example, that already with the 2020 budget law, the Government introduced the cutting of the tax wedge for the benefit of workers, which it then made structural.

If we keep in mind all the decrees-laws issued during the first stages of the emergency until the last budget law, we will also find structural measures, which can be interpreted in this perspective. Think of the 21 billion from 2020-2026: resources available in order to strengthen the hospital and territorial care network, enhance medical and nursing staff, hire health personnel, invest in the training of doctors and nurses. Think of measures for schools and universities: we have further strengthened interventions on organic, on digitalization, investments in school and university buildings, in research.\",\n",

I would also like to mention two measures to give meaning to interventions that express a vision for the country, aimed at improving the competitiveness of our productive fabric, made up mainly of small and medium-sized enterprises; but of course also large enterprises are struggling in this context of crisis. I am referring to the SME Equity Fund, managed by Invitalia, which promotes the capitalization of small and medium-sized enterprises that invest in their relaunch, and the Destined Equity Fund, managed by Cassa depositi e prestiti, which can contribute not only to the support but also to the growth of enterprises with a turnover of more than EUR 50 million. Then, also in view of the great challenge of the recovery plan, we wanted to redefine with clarity the regulatory framework to support investments, in particular those in infrastructure. In fact, we have defined an accelerated path for the implementation of public works; we have intervened to redefine very carefully the system of liability of the public administration, in particular with regard to the redefinition of pecuniary liability, to the delimitation of the offence of abuse of office. In this respect, I often hear the objection raised (and I have to say that it happened yesterday in the House) that, after a few months, the works, even if they were considered priority in the framework of the simplification decree, would still be blocked, because the designation of the relevant Commissioners would be missing. These works have never been blocked, because Article 2 of the simplification decree has been applied, which gives special powers specific to the commissioners to the RUP (the sole project managers). We have reached a total of 43.3 billion compared to 39.4 billion in 2019.

Yesterday I announced to the House, in the field of electoral law, the commitment of the Government, of course respecting the autonomous determinations of the parliamentary forces, to promote and contribute to achieving an electoral reform, as far as competence is concerned, of a proportional system, as much as possible shared (because it is a system law), which can effectively combine the reasons for pluralism and representation with the need, although inescapable, to ensure an overall stability of the political system. I would like to clarify this point, because I am reading malicious interpretations, so to speak. In recent years we have seen a fragmentation of representation. The framework of political forces has become differentiated and new processes have emerged, which have established themselves in a completely new and even disruptive way. If we want to reconstruct this picture, it is not possible to do so with an electoral law that forces so different sensibilities into the same envelope.

Obviously, these political forces, to govern, will be called upon to define programmatic agreements of high content and strong profile ideal, so as to generate governments based on clear programmes and able to offer a solid and fruitful perspective to all citizens. Of course, these political forces, in order to govern, will be called upon to define high-profile programmatic agreements with a strong ideal content, in order to generate governments based on clear programmes and capable of offering a solid and fruitful perspective to all citizens. The amendment of the electoral system can also be effectively accompanied by certain innovations in the institutional system, all the more necessary in view of the reduction in the number of parliamentarians, in line with the directions already shared by the majority parliamentary groups in the agreement reached in October 2019. It is then necessary to introduce some corrections to the form of government, inspired by the model of a rationalized parliamentarism that guarantees a more secure stability to the Executive and, at the same time, returns to Parliament a central role in defining the national political direction. As regards in particular the legislative procedure, some provisions aimed at rationalizing the approval of laws may be introduced, also in order to reduce the use of emergency decree, which in fact in the last year, due to the pandemic, has even more significantly increased or conditioned parliamentary activity.

In the opening part of my speech I claimed the political character of the choices made and the decisions taken. Politics is the noblest of the arts and of the sciences, because, if it is pursued in the right spirit and is always and in any case aimed at the well-being of citizens and the improvement of the quality of life, it becomes a very effective tool also for resolving the conflicts in society, for recognizing and coexisting differences and for interpreting situations, even the most diverse and distant. When politics is eclipsed, these demands end up on the margins, with the risk that they will remain unheard and therefore unheard or, worse, that they will turn into anger and lead to violent clashes. We have an urgency to do politics, all the more so in this context of widespread deprivation and deep suffering, because only politics offers us the possibility of interpreting the malaise of society, preventing it from exploding into destructive oppositions. Politics can help to make this malaise a productive and positive factor, a factor for the progress of the Nation. It is up to us, therefore, to promote and contribute to putting into political form the contradictions, aspirations, needs and the will on the part of all to express their potential. I think first of all of the workers and all the productive forces, which are the decisive components to be encouraged and promoted for the future of the Republic.

On the contrary: you yourself said that they must be done carefully, just as they are extraordinarily necessary today.

On one point, Mr President-in-Office, you are absolutely right: governing the unknown, in a tragedy that has claimed thousands of lives, is a burden that no one in Italy has ever borne since 1944. They want the pandemic to be tackled decisively, schools to reopen, the foundations for economic recovery to be laid: a fairer, freer Italy, in a world where politics prevails over multinationals and high finance. Precisely because their behaviour has been exemplary, Italians demand that we deal first with them and then perhaps with us and they want above all the certainty that this path takes place thanks to the stability and certainty of a binomial that is at the top of our state order and that naturally concerns the Presidency of the Republic and the Presidency of the Council of Ministers with its Government. It is obvious, it is known and it has been written since that day: today we do not need 161 votes for confidence, just read the Italian Constitution. It is true, it is certainly true that from 1944 to today there have been about ten Governments that did not originally enjoy an absolute majority. These are the cases of executives born without a majority in the Italian parliamentary experience. We know well that Italy is living in a state of emergency, but you have in your hands two extraordinary opportunities already mentioned by Senator Monti. Afflicted by the fear of a third epidemic wave, gripped by a fierce economic crisis, the decisive year in which the negative turn of history can be reversed is exactly this and it is 2021 for two reasons: the first was certain from the fall, the other was not. And they are the certainty that we have the vaccine and, therefore, the obligation to rush to vaccinate most Italians; the other was in the recovery plan, which this Group has helped to change profoundly and for which today we need a board of directors, the projects must be defined and I allow myself to point out that it must be put in synergy with a recovery plan from the public debt to prevent the central subject of the recovery plan, which is not me but my children, from having a public debt on his shoulders, which will probably be able to lock in particularly many of his efforts. It would be a mistake to face this challenge without a long-term political project. Let us imagine if you govern with one less vote. Mr President, then I ask you how the ideas you presented yesterday in the Chamber and today in the Senate are turned into projects. I appreciate that a truth has finally been shared: a government with a majority built on a miracle fishery was useless, even harmful. I too had - I rarely get that; believe me - a very hot phone and maybe it was Agostino Depretis who called me, misquoted by the person who should read the story. He reformed the secular and compulsory school up to the age of ten. To those who asked me, I replied that I didn't look like a barber's chair. You understood. Today, however, you set a strategy in two steps: a vote of confidence and then a majority. I share its preamble: a determined opposition to any form of nationalism - it is the evil of Europe - because we have also touched here with our own hands the bad reasons of those who keep Europe in their sights and consider our Western position an accident to be contended with incessant dialogues with Putin's Russia, but that is the wrong way. The hunt for the different, a ferocious language and terra-pallism have eroded spaces of freedom and individual rights here too and this risk can never be run again. If we need to work to never run it again - I quote Nenni and it will be the only quote I make - out of rancor to achieve a space of unity, this is the way that must be followed. You clearly addressed LeU, the Democratic Party, the 5 Star Movement and appealed to willing political forces who recall the popular, liberal and socialist tradition. These are the three families that lead most European countries; one of these was Matteo Renzi, then leader of the Democratic Party, who led the Party of European Socialism six years ago. One of these sits authoritatively among the benches of his government. I do not know whether the Democratic Party shares your intention or not: at least, I did not see any sign, either positive or negative, in yesterday's debate in Montecitorio. Mr President, I do know that the Socialists will assess your proposal in time, given that in recent months we have supported your government as stateless people: we are not part of it; we have never received an invitation to take part in meetings in which important decisions were being prepared. When we disagreed, we did not resort to small claims, but we expressed our disagreement here in the light of the sun loyally and even twice with two opposing votes on specific issues in confidence in you. The only notes he received from us were on programmatic points which we felt had not been addressed with the necessary determination. I repeat: we are only interested in a project of rebirth for Italy, to know its contents. I too have a proposal to make to you.\",\n",

It asks us to be aware of the arduous task before us: to come out of the pandemic; overcome the current economic emergency; and finally to address the historical critics, namely the insufficient infrastructure, the slow and unwieldy public administration, the public and the expanding growth of women and young people, the unstoppable structural and territorial investments, and an ever-increasing social and economic penalty that becomes an ever-increasing national penalty. We, the country's ruling class, have the historic responsibility to support the needs of individuals, families and businesses, and not to selfishly burden the new generations with the cyclical burden of a debt that has been pushed to a level that will not be bearable unless accompanied by adequate economic growth. Europe is certainly the hallmark of the forces that appeal to this majority, and I am pleased that you, Mr President-in-Office, have emphasised this appropriately. This is the signal we must give to this debate: how to honour the European Union's extraordinary act of trust in our country, which has made a colossal contribution of resources available to us. We are faced, in this sense, with a great challenge, that of human capital.

We have some categories (self-employed, professionals, operators in the local economy) that are literally on their knees; we have a vaccine programme full of difficulties and unforeseen events; we have some time to recover before our recovery plan is credible in Europe. A country which denies this possibility even in an emergency is a weaker country. Some of the difficulties I have highlighted are objective and common to other countries as well. Some, in our analysis, stem from government choices that we did not share: from the institutional to the economic to the choices in the face of the pandemic emergency. And it is because of this conviction, as you know, Mr President-in-Office, that we have never so far voted for your confidence. While we have not shared and understood the ways and, above all, the timing in which the crisis was proposed by them. Democracy can take account of circumstances. Ignoring this riskensures that many good reasons are discredited in the eyes of the public. The question we have asked ourselves, however, is this: can a crisis which has occurred at the wrong time and in the wrong way, and which has developed entirely within the old majority, cause those who have hitherto opposed your government to change their minds about it?It reminded me of the use of the term 'anti-fascism' in the 1970s, which was so abused that it lost all real meaning. At the time, a great intellectual, a communist and a conservative, Pier Paolo Pasolini, warned us against this risk. My constituency is democratic, liberal, anti-sovereignty, pro-European because it refers to the Europe of the founding fathers. You, on the other hand, by proposing a Government that does not even change its cardinal number (we are always talking about Count 2), have legitimately claimed the work done so far, which we have so far legitimately opposed. He asked the others, citing his speech, to enrich this base: in other words, to 'add'. In short, what you have proposed to the anti-sovereignty opponents (and I repeat that we at Idea and Change rather consider ourselves to be a-sovereignty, because even on this category we should agree) in technical terms was not even a transformist proposal, as has been said. As you know, Mr President, and as you teach me, in the definition given by Agostino Depretis, transformism implied, precisely, a transformation: both for those who joined the Government and for the Government itself, which changed its centre of gravity, moving, depending on the case, more to the right or more to the left; more towards the monarchy or more towards Parliament.

Or to improve the recovery plan ?But all the parties worked on the first document, bringing proposals (we did it, the 5 Star Movement did it and Italia Viva did it) and, according to everyone, the document has improved thanks to everyone's contribution and can still improve in Parliament. To have the legislative pact?We have been strongly supporting this for months: we need a clear perimeter, a political perspective and a cohesive and strong pact to support a government action that must be strong and live up to the gravitas and the difficult situation our country is experiencing. We must work to build and not to destroy. Mr President of the Council, we will vote for confidence because with this Government Italy has finally recovered that part of its history which is fundamental to its identity. Italy is one of the founding countries of Europe.\",\n",

Do we really think that we would get so many resources and so much credit with an anti-European sovereignist government?Mr President-in-Office, the Government then faced an unprecedented difficulty, one that no executive in Italy had ever faced before. We acknowledge this to you and the entire government. Let's end this with the narrative of a failed government on the pandemic. It is true that the death toll in Italy is high, but can anyone blame it on the executive's handling of the pandemic?There are weaknesses in healthcare that relate to previous periods and there has been a spread of the virus that hardly any government measure could have imagined or stopped. I therefore believe that in the pandemic emergency the Government, despite the mistakes that each of us could have made, has behaved with dignity and honour. Now, Mr President of the Council, with this confidence that we renew, we also ask you to go ahead and do so for a new and strong start, defining the political perimeter of a renewed majority, which must be strong and cohesive, with that pact of legislature that you mentioned in your speech. You said that many things could be done during the current parliamentary term and I would endorse all of them, but I would like to emphasize in particular the theme of institutional reforms, because it is nothing more than making the State work well; talking about the rules of the game, how the State works, what the relationship between the State and the Regions is is essential if all the other reforms, in a cascade, are to work, so it is a very important part. The first measures announced by Biden really show a change of pace compared to what Trump did; in particular, I am referring to that multilateralism that has always been a hallmark of Italian politics, in which we believe deeply. Finally, I make a request to all of us, but especially to the Government. We need to make sure that what we say is effective and timely in affecting people's lives. This is fundamental. I understand that there are a lot of difficulties, but I think it must be a real daily grind for those who are in government today. I conclude with important words from a biblical book, the Qohelet, which however seem to me very appropriate at this stage: There is a time to be born and a time to die, a time to plant and a time to uproot what has been planted, a time to demolish and a time to build.

The dialectical confrontation is a sign of vitality and wealth, but it is healthy if it is done with a purposeful spirit, aimed at improving the action of the Government and certainly not at demolishing it and distracting it from those objectives, which today are absolutely essential for a real recovery of our country. For a year, Italy, like Europe and the whole world, has been overwhelmed by a health tsunami, which has put to the test the economic and social strength of our civil life. Families, businesses, workers, young people and the elderly are asking questions, which are often difficult to answer. Entire categories of workers are on their knees and anxiously waiting to know what will happen to them. The first to respond to the call to arms were the doctors, nurses, health workers, technicians and volunteers, who put their lives at the service of the country and illuminated our hopes. They did so to save our nation, in compliance with the measures imposed by the Government, which found itself facing what no one would have expected and did it at its best, albeit with some imperfections, achieving encouraging results compared to the spread of the pandemic and also receiving the applause of Europe. All the other measures taken to contain the resulting economic crisis, from the resumption decrees, to the restoration decree, to the 2021 budget law, have certainly provided relief, but compared to the serious losses that the economic sector has suffered, I believe that more should be done, for example by taking as a criterion not only the Ateco codes, but also the loss of turnover of companies. The National Recovery and Resilience Plan, approved by the Government and significantly improved in the latest version, sets out the objectives, reforms and investments that Italy wants to achieve with the European funds of the Next Generation EU. At the heart of our democracy, we have to decide how we want to tackle these momentous issues: we can decide to scrap, destroy, blow up the bench and go back to square one; or we can choose to build and start from here, we can choose to use this House as a privileged place for debate.

I thought about the end of this year and what has just begun, with still too many sick people, with still too many deaths, but with two new elements of hope: the first, the vaccine and the extraordinary vaccine campaign, which we have a duty to organize and monitor as best we can and which can give us greater health security for ourselves and our loved ones, especially the most fragile. Second, the resources of the recovery plan, the financing projects, the possibility of investing more funds than ever before in strategic matters for our present and future well-being. In this framework, in this stream of images, from February 2020 to today (less than a year, but very long for the richness and quantity of events), the government crisis is inserted: unexpected, wrong in ways and times. In a context like the one we are going through and have been through, can we afford a government crisis?The best response to the inevitable difficulties we are facing, even to the limitations we may sense in government action, is really to open a crisis?My answer is no, absolutely no. Not because the pandemic entails a kind of suspension of politics, I want to say this to the friends of Viva Italia, not because you have to give up criticism or discussion: no, it's not that. This is certainly not the view of the Democratic Party. From Secretary Zingaretti, to the head of the delegation Franceschini, to the Head of the Group, the request for a correction of the Government's action and, above all, the proposal for a renewed legislative pact came repeatedly, which was able to define a strategic horizon of priority to be pursued, not based on the management of the emergency, but on the renaissance. We asked for and obtained the opening of a discussion and a verification. That would have been the right place to find greater collegiality, to clarify and resolve the problems, to continue the path of government in a renewed way.

At such a difficult time, Italy was able to intervene quickly to stop this epidemic. On the vaccine front, it was one of the first to intervene: we are the nation in Europe with the highest number of vaccinated to date, and this is a figure we have thanks to the action taken by Minister Esperanza and this majority.',\n",
              " 'We are also concerned about the economic measures to combat the crisis: more than 40 measures to combat the epidemic; more than 100 billion have been provided for in the four amendments we have already voted on and another will be voted on in the coming days, amounting to some 32 billion.',\n",

              " \"Mr President Conte, I have already expressed my personal closeness and support to you and I do so also on behalf of the whole 5-Star Movement, all in one block. I am going to conclude by quoting a book which I invite everyone to read, 'The Perfume of Hope', written by a young Trapani policeman, adopted when he was in prison and who, at a certain point in his life, felt the need to find his roots.

The author has made a solo journey that has led him, a bit like the salmon, against the current, to find his origins and his biological parents in Brazil. Here, Mr. President Conte, I like to conclude: you are giving the Italians that scent of hope for a re-start that must absolutely be there; go ahead, don't look back, that behind you there will be the whole 5 Star Movement, the whole majority, but above all the Italian people. Go ahead!Mr President, I would like to conclude by saying that you are giving the Italians that scent of hope for a new beginning which must absolutely take place. Go ahead, don't look back, because behind you there will be the whole Five Star Movement, the majority, but above all the Italian people. Keep going!\",\n",

Cohesion, inequalities and sustainable and technological development call our attention to the Mezzogiorno and the islands. Twenty years ago, we lost the opportunity to integrate the Mediterranean area into the trans-European networks, which are essential for the completion of the single European market. Since then, the economic and social conditions in the Mezzogiorno have all deteriorated, also as a result of the combined effects of the geopolitical changes in the Mediterranean area following the new winds of war after 11 September 2001. With the parameters chosen to allocate resources - unemployment, per capita income, high youth emigration and depopulation, and cumulative loss of GDP - 111 of the 209 billion euro would be attributable to the South and the island system. It is in Italy's interest that the Mezzogiorno can contribute to national wealth. Resources should be prioritised to close the growing infrastructure gap between the southern and northern regions of Italy. Bridging the gaps in road networks, high-speed railways, port infrastructure and motorways by sea is essential in order to put in place a system in a territory now fragmented by coastal areas, ports and inland areas that are mutually inaccessible. It would be necessary to promote economic activities in harmony with the nature of the territories. Such structural interventions should also make a decisive contribution to mitigating seismic and hydrogeological risk. Equally important are investments in technological and scientific infrastructures, such as the Einstein Telescope, which could provide an opportunity for development and at the same time contain the flight of young and creative minds. The question of ius soli can no longer be postponed and was already raised by some government forces at the time of Count 2. It must now be taken up again and put on the agenda. Equal attention should be paid to the transparency of documents held by the State and hitherto classified and therefore not available for consultation by citizens. I 'm sorry .\",\n",

              " 'An institutional crisis has not yet been opened, because you have not resigned from the Quirinal, but there are three big, enormous and dramatic crises, which have been open for a long time and certainly not because of you, Mr President. The first is the economic one: Italy is the worst-placed country from the point of view of the fall in GDP in the year 2020, with a decrease of 10 percent, and the optimistic forecasts of the Ministry of Economy and Finance, which predict a growth of 6 percent, are denied first of all by the Bank of Italy, which for 2021 forecasts a growth halved compared to that of the Executive. So we have a negative record: we are the worst economy in the world. There is a second dramatic element, which is the health crisis. Our nurses, our doctors and our staff are amazing, but Italy is the country in the world that has the worst ratio of population to COVID deaths. We need to invest more in health, do it better and do it now. The third and final point, which I want to mention, among many others, concerns our negative record in the education and school crisis. It is never discussed in a strategic and complete way and when, in March 2020, I tried, together with my colleagues, to propose to organize in time to start school again, there was a unanimous chorus, saying that it was not the time. The fact is that Italy is the country that sent its children to school the least of all others in Europe. I would have expected an ambitious list from you: not headlines or a summary of open points, but a big dream for the country\\'s future, a vision or a horizon. Mr President of the Council, you were afraid to go up to the Quirinal the day after you resigned, not because you put the country\\'s destiny at the centre, but because you chose an institutional backdrop, which I hope is useful for you and for the Government, but which I fear is harmful to the institutions. She asked for clarity, transparency and frankness and, as she sees it, she is satisfied. Mr President, do not misuse your intelligence, which I respect. For months we have been respectfully asking you in this House for a change. In May, Minister Bonafede, who sits to your right, was the subject of a motion of censure, which we shared. In July, I stood up from this bench and asked that August be devoted solely to discussing the recovery plan, but we were not followed or satisfied; indeed, in December, when an indecent draft of the recovery plan arrived in the Council of Ministers and we said that it was not appropriate to talk about it, a minister in his government said that Renzi was like Orban, because he wanted to block the recovery plan. In November, we met twice at Palazzo Chigi and her hospitality was as extraordinary as ever; we decided to have a political table within the month, to close the open issues. In December, we wrote her a four-page letter, to which she never replied. In January we sent the Democratic Party and the others in the coalition a list with the 30 main files. For months we have been asking you to change and we are asking you for a change. It is not true that we have been impatient or irresponsible, perhaps we have been too patient. He said that this is not the time for a crisis: many people have said this, including my friends at the bar. The communication has passed: this is not the time to open a crisis. I respect you, Mr President, but this is the time to look within ourselves, really and thoroughly, and decide. You, who know Greek better than I do, know that this is a kairòs, an opportune moment, because now or never you can have the discussion. Mr. President, it\\'s now or never, because we have a new President of the United States of America. Today is the last night that Donald Trump will sleep in Lincoln\\'s room; from tomorrow a new page opens, with Joe Biden, with multilateralism, with a man leading the United States who has a great passion for Europe and for Italy. Mr President, it\\'s now or never because, a few days ago, while we were arguing and discussing, Macron and Merkel struck a deal with the European institutions together with China, and we, who had been the first to sign, among a thousand controversies, the One Belt One Road project, didn\\'t even enter the game. Mr President, it is now or never, because Brexit is now playing its part. What a dream it would be to enable younger people to finally imagine a big investment in the universities and institutes that are currently struggling because of the lack of Erasmus in the UK. How nice it would be to turn our universities into a centre of attraction! How nice it would be to discuss young people and the future, and not just domestic problems!Now or never, because this is the year of the G20 and COP26. Now or never, Mr President, because now we have to send the children back to school. In this regard, we made a small proposal, not talk: we suggested starting next week and giving the 476,000 doses of Pfizer vaccine to the 435 teachers in the middle and lower secondary schools. It is now or never for the economy, because if we continue with a logic of small and micro interventions, which unfortunately has also involved partly the budget law, we will not get out of the crisis. We are 160% in debt; our children are locked in their homes and will pay the bill for this crisis more than anyone else. What next generation EU, if we are not in a position to leave our children nothing but mountains of debt?It is now or never for the ESM, Mr President: we are investing €2,700 per head in health and Germany 5.100; will there be a link between these two things or not?Saying no to the ESM in June has cost the national community €564 million to date. I am thinking of the whole Amaldi plan, the research plan that, for example, many researchers have asked to be able to finance. I am thinking of all the investments we can make for local medicine, but also for personalised medicine and for technological innovation. Either we do it now or it\\'ll never come back. Sorry if I\\'m being obnoxious, but we\\'ll be cursed by our children if we don\\'t invest in schools and healthcare now. Let me tell you that these are political issues; you may agree or disagree, but this is what we have been discussing so far: artificial intelligence, not poverty eradication; the lottery of receipts, not the cities of the future; the NIMBY logic, not how to do green jobs, green jobs, the possibility of increasing employment; who should buy the Monte dei Paschi of Siena relying on the same consultants who twenty years ago already made enough of a mess, not the third sector and the social economy. All over the world - and anyone who travels the world, even now, or who works with international institutions anyway knows this - we are preparing for a huge rebound in tourism, because after people have been kept at home for a year and a half, when in six or three months - hopefully as soon as possible - vaccines will allow us to get back to normal, there will be a crazy surge of investment in tourism. We asked that the Next Generation EU could invest more. Who loses today?Someone says Conte, Renzi or Italia Viva. I think of that page of I Malavoglia - which you certainly know better than me - where Uncle Crucifisso receives the news that in the battle someone from the country, Luca, has died; the special says that, in short, in the end they lost a battle and it\\'s a bad thing, but, when asked who lost, he answers: I, you, ALL in short, Italy. And at that moment, Bellwood replies, \"I haven\\'t lost anything\". It seems that the discussion is about individuals: I have lost nothing; we have lost nothing, Mr President; but it is Italy that is losing the worst thing to lose, which is the greatest opportunity, more than the Marshall Plan. Chairs, posts, jobs pass, they are lost and taken back; opportunities never come again. That is why I say act now and I ask you, Mr President Conte, to make a big investment in the future.',\n",

She tried desperately to offer dignity to those who, if they voted for her, would only have the disgust reserved for traitors; disgust - watch out - that in her heart and in your heart you also reserve for those who change the flag. She tried, but failed to divide the center-right and appealed officially to those who, in her view, could represent important political cultures to add to the post-communists, post-Stalinists, the crickets and already prosperous who vote for her; she addresses liberals, populists, autonomists, socialists and those who have the most, all together. However, not only we of the Fratelli d'Italia, who call ourselves patriots; not only the League, which you say you do not want like the fox with the grapes, but also Forza Italia, Toti, Lupi, Quagliarello, Cesa and the most socialist of all those present here, that is Stefania Craxi, said no. You know very well, however, that in any case you will not get to 161 votes; in any case you will not reach that majority of those entitled to vote and this despite the incomprehensible support of the senators for life, who thus risk giving reason to those who would like to abolish the article of the Constitution that allows them to be in this House. President-in-Office, Mr Conte, I challenge you to declare in your reply that if by any chance you pass the votes of the centre-right - I do not think that will happen - thanks to the Renzi senators - whether one, two or all 17 - you will not accept those votes after what you have heard from Renzi and you will resign. It would be possible if they had done so in a transparent way; they did not, and so I challenge you: you must have 161 votes or at least one more than the centre-right without the votes of the Renzians or you must resign. I don't say anything new and I don't even say it out of respect if I remember that all the newspapers of a few days ago interpreted the Guarantor of the Constitution's thinking by attributing to him the intention that, in the presence of a crisis, the only way would be the elections. Do you really think that the President of the Republic will lie to keep you entertained? Do you not remember that the last centre-right government of Berlusconi, on 8 November 2011, beat the opposition on the previous year's budget report with votes that did not represent an absolute majority, went to the Hill and resigned, as the then President of the Republic had asked him to do?It was November 12, 2011 and she had 309 votes in the House. President, I believe that if you can get one more vote than the center-right, you should resign immediately. The main road is to give back the voice to the people. The main road is to hear what the Italians think of your government and what government they want. I believe that you should resign immediately if you do not reach that level, even in the unfortunate event that you outvote the centre-right later. You can pretend to believe that one day everyone must answer to the voters who sent them here and another day that the Constitution guarantees everyone to think the opposite, but there is a limit to everything.\",\n",

Reasoned judgement: this crisis is a serious and irresponsible act. What counts most and makes the judgement about who started this crisis is the short circuit that has taken place in the country. This is the problem. And I would like to say to Senator Renzi that this short circuit is not the result of communication, but is the substance of a country that cannot understand, in the face of over 80,000 deaths and a dramatic economic crisis, the opening of a crisis.',\n",

Was everything all right?As you know, President Conte, I have pointed out several times that everything was not going well, even if no one can lecture here, because we are in an unprecedented situation. I have said many times that no one can behave like the one who has the truth in his pocket. But the paradox is that this is happening at the very moment when we were working to make a leap of quality, and the conditions were there. We had changed and improved the recovery plan, but someone decided to open the crisis, with all that this means internationally (just read the press release). What should be the outcome of this crisis in the dark?Look: it's not a matter of grudges or resentments; I'm afraid the problem is more serious. The question we have to ask ourselves is this: if we say nothing happened, will the country understand?This is the problem. In the face of a political action that is disruptive and dismantling, you cannot pretend that nothing has happened; the credibility of the policy is at stake. I therefore want to take this crisis seriously. And it is clear that political manoeuvring cannot be used to solve it, but - as you said, Mr President - a revival is needed here, with a clear political project. Moreover, if we want to be clear, today the political confrontation in the world, in Europe and even in Italy is very clear and is based on two visions; we have seen it in the United States, even in its most dramatic aspects, and it is also so here. On the one hand, there is a sovereignist right and at the same time a libertarian junta, which invests in fear and urges all selfishness; and if anyone had doubts, the dramatic idea of distributing vaccines according to GDP is a sad and tragic confirmation.\",\n",

Besides, the mechanism is always the same: if you're so good, why are you terrified of voting?And if everything was fine before, why is there now a need to change the rules?Ex multis, last November 21, President Ursula von der Leyen told us on Twitter that no rules should stand in the way of governments' efforts to pump euros into the economy; no rules should. So, even today, he recognized that there was a problem with the governance of the best of all possible worlds, the Europeanist world. It was not going well, and it would have been surprising, considering the hands we are in: in the hands of von der Leyen herself, who as Minister of Labour of the Federal Republic of Germany, on 23 August 2011, joined the Finnish request to mortgage the Parthenon, a request that did not go very well for Finland. We are in the hands of those who delayed a strong united European response by waiting for the pandemic to hit home: this is an objective fact and von der Leyen herself apologised for it. I'm going to put the numbers back in writing: according to the latest estimates of the Bank of Italy in 2020 the GDP decreased by 9 percent, reaching the level of 1998, but in this leap backwards of twenty-two years I want to draw your attention to one point. So, even before the crisis, the country was 15 years behind, and even before the crisis, it would have taken 20 years to get back to the level of GDP of 2007, in the wonderful Europeanist world of rules. Between 1960 and 2011, public investment in this country grew by an average of 1.7 percent a year. If this growth were to continue, they would have to reach around 44 billion euros between 2012 and 2019, but in 2019 investments amounted to 28 billion euros. Yes, you heard it right: you have to go back to the year of Aldo Moro's kidnapping to have such a low level of public investment in Italy, but since then GDP has doubled. How can we think of meeting the infrastructure needs of an economy that has doubled in volume with a supply of infrastructure that might have been adequate forty-three years ago?Do we want to reflect together on these figures that concern not only the League voters but all voters?This absurd result, these reckless cuts, are not the children of NN, but are the children of MM, and for this reason it is particularly hateful to us to witness the reckless and sterile dialectical acrobatics, of those who keep telling us that the good of the whole can be achieved by doing harm to the parties and thus think to express a liberal thought, with the truancy of those who feel that they are the depositary of the truth - and also say they are, among other things - being in reality only the bearer of an epochal failure, from which everyone today distances themselves. Any plan to revive the country's economy is bound to fail, without abandoning or at least a deep rethinking of the rules that stopped the recovery in 2012. I know that there is an awareness of this in a part of the majority (I would say in a very large part) and it was right of Senator Pittella to ask President von der Leyen on 16 September that the Stability Pact be not only suspended, but also rewritten. The question I ask myself and we all have to ask ourselves is what happened to this request. As far as we know, nothing has happened, because the so-called Europe has not changed and the rhetoric of reforms, which the Prime Minister has reiterated, is here to refute the rhetoric of change. The reforms, as the usual colleague has authoritatively reminded us, are always those of August 2011 and are always those of Draghi's letter: cuts and taxes. So, ladies and gentlemen of the majority, the truth is that nobody in Europe listens to you, and this is important for the country. Ladies and gentlemen, you can also sell your voters authority in Europe, which is in fact just complacency, but here we are culturally equipped enough to understand that, if there was authority, Mr Pittella's question would already have had an answer, because as a European - not a Europeanist - I can tell you that in other European countries the debate on rules exists, is far ahead and that is the train we are missing. On the other hand, ceding makes you fragile in Europe, as lies make you fragile at home, but the root of the evil is always the same, namely the misalignment of Parliament from the country and the misalignment of representatives from representatives. This political data is very serious, but obviously does not disturb those who had as a program the abolition of representative democracy, selling the easy illusion that, from their own home sofa, you could command the world with a click, and does not disturb, of course, even those who have the certainty of being able to govern regardless of consent, thanks to the banks that, for now, he finds in the Italian and especially European apparatus.

It happened to Theresa May, because of the no-deal Brexit. And it's happening these days in Israel, all about corruption, fraud and abuse of power. Rui Rio, leader of the Portuguese opposition, expressed it in these words: the threat we must combat demands unity, responsibility and a sense of solidarity. This is the spirit in Europe and the world. Then, of course, it is true: there are countries where the health crisis has been supplemented by the political crisis: in addition to Israel and the Netherlands, there are Poland, Brazil, Peru, Kyrgyzstan, Lebanon and Nepal. There will be reasons of extraordinary gravity, one might think, although 70 per cent of Italians say they have not understood these reasons. It's been years since we've seen such an effective anti-politics ad for anyone who claims that politics is far from people's real problems and that politicians are only interested in their own gains. And if this crisis isn't understandable to Italian citizens, imagine that Europe has made an investment of confidence in Italy with the biggest aid package since the Marshall Plan. It is not particularly understandable in Germany, where Chancellor Merkel and President von der Leyen have spent on aid to Italy through the principle that no one is to blame for the pandemic crisis and that those most affected should be supported.\",\n",

              " 'BELLANOVA (IV-PSI). - (IT) Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, Mr President-in-Office of the Council, the question that is repeated over and over again is always the same: can a government crisis be opened in the midst of a pandemic and a dramatic situation such as the one the country is experiencing?Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, Mr President-in-Office, the question that echoes over and over again is always the same: in the midst of a pandemic and a dramatic situation such as the one the country is experiencing, can we open a government crisis?A legitimate question, we are aware of it, but misleading. The truth, which his speech completely eludes, is radically different and questions the very foundations of democracy in our country: can a government, in the face of a pandemic that has no sign of retreating, to a dramatic situation like the one we are experiencing and as far as possible facing, make the emergency its only reason for existence, even the only motivation for its existence?The real question, which his speech completely eludes, is radically different and questions the very foundations of democracy in our country: can a Government, faced with a pandemic that does not hint at retreating, a dramatic situation like the one we are experiencing and as far as possible facing, make the emergency its only reason for existence, even the only reason for its existence?It must be a vision of the future and a new beginning to say whether or not this Government can lead the country, enabling it to overcome the difficulties, to reform the many structures that have shown signs of great weakness, to start the economic and social recovery it deserves. It must be a vision of the future and a new start to say whether or not this Government can lead the country, allowing it to overcome difficulties, to reform the many structures that have shown signs of great weakness, to start the economic and social recovery it deserves. Resilience is an empty word if all this is lacking and all this in its intervention is desperately lacking. Could a Government, in the management of the most important amount of resources on which our country will rely in the near future, exhaust itself, its Ministers, the Regions, the public administration and Parliament, to entrust everything to a group of managers and technicians chosen with no one knows what criteria?Could a government, in the management of the most important resource base on which our country will rely in the near future, exhaust itself, its ministers, the regions, the public administration and Parliament, in order to entrust everything to a group of managers and technicians chosen by no one knows what criteria?It could have done so in the absence of an explicit perspective, of a modern and progressive vision of our society and our economy, without a real dialogue with Parliament, with the political forces, as well as with the social forces. We have noted your partial rethinking, Mr President, but we have also recorded the attempts you made to the last to surreptitiously convey the formula so dear to you of an opaque task force, improperly called upon to guarantee the governance process. We have noted your partial rethinking, Mr President, but we have also recorded your attempts to the last minute to surreptitiously convey the formula so dear to you of an opaque task force, improperly called upon to guarantee the governance process. It is a step forward which we claim for our action to have brought the management of recovery back into the framework of constitutional and institutional correctness, abandoning the idea of opaque technical solutions.',\n",
              " 'However, we still do not know the model of governance that is being proposed and we believe that the Parliament has every right to know, not by its own accord, but by constitutional right. The vulnus produced remains, the continuous attempts to circumvent the problems and to marginalize those in the majority who have put them and continue to put them. It is unforgivable the time lost in this way when the country needed, like other European nations, to run. It is the real point of trust, not the more or less credible enlargement to variable, improvised and collectivized majorities, to an incomprehensible political mixed-up, not a new governance, but only an unspeakable exchange. This is not the iron fist between Viva Italia, Matteo Renzi and the president; it is the test bench to decide whether respect for the Constitution and the public interest prevail or the improvisation of tactics and techniques, all to be demonstrated in their effectiveness and institutional correctness; whether politics prevail, the vision of the future and the ability to adapt or the interest of a party, mobilisation, the negotiation under the bank in favour of a few and the interdependence of many. The extraordinary pandemic emergency of this country that has more than twenty years of unprecedented unemployment rates, finds serious responses to unsatisfactory growth rates, severe losses in competitiveness, a severe recovery that fails to recover;',\n",
              " 'A weak position on the European scene and a very fragile one on the international scene.',\n",
              " 'Mr President, let us be frank in this House: the position you have taken on the events on Capitol Hill has been weak, embarrassingly weak.',\n",
              " 'The difficulties of the country, multiplied by the emergency, are before our eyes, every day. In recent days the Bank of Italy has also confirmed this: we have known for months that the end of the blockade on redundancies could coincide with a social deterioration of terrible proportions.',\n",
              " 'You know this, we have repeatedly said it to you and delivered it in the many evening majority meetings, as you know perfectly well that it was we reformists who raised questions on worrying issues, such as the serious decline in women\\'s employment, which can also be attributed to the lack of a useful strategy for reopening schools, the urgency of active policies or concrete support for new poverty. If we do not unblock the construction sites, employment will not resume. The delay of months in waiting for the Commissioners to be appointed is inexcusable. The social partners have asked for the extension of the Covid integration fund and the blockade on dismissals, but we all know that continuing to extend will not remove the risk that the end of the blockade will lead to the loss, already estimated, of over one and a half million jobs. Without a reform of the shock absorbers in a universal sense, without a training plan, without relocation, there is no hope for new policies. I should not be the one to remind you of the hundreds of open disputes, which are at risk of multiplying, nor the thread on which hangs the fate of thousands of workers, from Ilva, Alitalia, to Whirlpool, to the smallest crisis table. It is difficult to think that a policy of bonuses and redundancies alone can provide useful, worthy and profitable answers. Without a new industrial policy that chooses the sectors, industries and supply chains to target, there is no incentive or bonus that can provide lasting answers to these workers and their families. It is true that there are enormous fears about the future in the productive fabric and in the world of work. The alarm about the political and financial powers, who think they can take advantage of this moment to buy Italy and colonize our companies, as well as the one about the pervasiveness of organized crime, is realistic, but without a real and concrete foreign and trade policy, consistent with Europe, we can never hope to compete and we will be doomed to succumb to world competition. Today it is no longer necessary?Or does it coincide with the enlargement of the purely majority, useful to oust the only truly critical voice, with which you until yesterday were measured?Why not pick up the urgency, which has led us for months to ask for a public debate on the recovery plan and a programmatic review, for a legislative pact?Why hesitate to discuss good debt?Why does the MES still allow ideological prejudice to prevail, rather than a close analysis of the cost-benefit relationship, the only one that should make sense in the face of the health emergency, which is engulfing the country?It is not just Covid the health emergency in this country. The point is here, not in the caricature personalization of a duel, but in the confrontation between a country that cannot give up the necessary reformism, which brings it back to the height of its best energies, to relaunch the European and international role, and a residual country, the great sick of Europe, with the \"hope\" of being too big to fail. The difference between reformism, growth and welfare is here; the concrete knot of using what we have at our disposal until the last euro is here, and this is why we have always asked for a strategy to face the emergency and open the doors to the next. The pandemic worries everyone, not only those who use paternalistic tones; we are extremely worried about the moment that citizens find themselves living. The country does not need a Highlander, but an authoritative ruling class, who can look not only at how to deal with the emergency, but who can engage the healthy forces of the country in building a vision, winning strategies, a timetable that looks at the speed of today while safeguarding tomorrow. Staying at home alone has never been enough and is no longer enough. President, we have explained at length the reasons for our resignation in the letter to you and President Mattarella: an act of responsibility, ours, with which we hoped that you could finally find the time to stop and reflect on how much we have been asking for you for months.',\n",

There is no budget deficit, because you don't know if there is a majority.

For two terms in the House, she was a reference on this subject, but, beyond the political sensitivity that led her to work to support culture and make it accessible to everyone, Emilia really understood culture, music and theatre: she had so much to teach about this and this sensitivity gave her the opportunity to cultivate so many relationships and to get in touch with worlds often far from politics.

              "  \"Since the first day of provisional application of CETA, the 125 European geographical indications have therefore begun to benefit from full protection under the Agreement and this result has made it possible to resolve the phenomenon of Italian sounding and counterfeiting of some of our excellent agri-food products. As for the geographical indications for which coexistence with trademarks already registered in Canada was envisaged (in particular, Parmigiano Reggiano, three Italian hams and three our cheeses), this solution, chosen to protect the rights acquired by local operators, has nevertheless allowed the protection of some European products previously considered generic names, as well as allowing the marketing of some products, in particular Parma ham. As regards the geographical indications for which coexistence with trademarks already registered in Canada was envisaged (in particular, Parmigiano Reggiano, three Italian hams and three our cheeses), this solution, chosen to protect the rights acquired by local operators, nevertheless allowed the protection of certain European products previously considered generic names, as well as allowing the marketing of certain products, in particular Parma ham. The latter, in fact, before CETA could not be entered on the Canadian market with its name, but only as original ham, given the existence of a trademark Parma registered forty years earlier. The latter, before CETA, could not be placed on the Canadian market with its name, but only as  original ham, given the existence of a trademark  Parma registered forty years earlier. In addition, the Agreement contains specific provisions against Italian sounding, such as the prohibition of evocation for non-originating products (i.e. the prohibition of the use of symbols, photos, colours and the like which may evoke the origin of the geographical indication), the obligation to indicate the origin on the label in a clear and visible manner, the obligation to further differentiate for products introduced on the market after a certain date, which must bear the indication of  use/imitation  style and so on, as well as the possibility of administrative recourse by the proprietors of individual intellectual property rights of geographical indications. Furthermore, the Agreement contains specific provisions against Italian sounding, such as the prohibition of evocation for non-originating products (i.e. the prohibition on the use of symbols, photographs, colours and the like which may evoke the origin of the geographical indication), the obligation to indicate the origin on the label in a clear and visible manner, the obligation for further differentiation for products placed on the market after a certain date, which must bear the words  style/imitation  and so on, and the possibility of administrative recourse by holders of intellectual property rights in individual geographical indications. In the light of the foregoing, therefore, and with reference to the further point made by the applicant concerning the timing of imports into the European Union of products bearing the designation Parmesan originating in Canada, it is clear that European legislation expressly prohibits their marketing, since the term Parmesan is not generic but is an evocation of the designation Parmigiano Reggiano and as such cannot be used in the European Union for cheeses which do not comply with the specifications of the Italian PDO. Import cases which infringe the exclusive right in the Union of the PDO Parmigiano Reggiano and its synonyms may be reported to the competent authorities of the Member States - in the case of Italy, it is the Central Authority for the Protection of Food Quality and the Suppression of Agricultural Fraud (RFICQ) and the Ministry of Agricultural Policy, in accordance with the Uniform Rules. Any cases of import infringing the exclusive right in the Union of the PDO Parmigiano Reggiano and its synonyms may be reported to the competent authorities of the Member States - in the case of Italy, it is the Central Inspectorate for the Protection of Quality and Combating Fraud in Agri-Food Products (ICQRF) of the Ministry of Agricultural, Food and Forestry Policies, pursuant to Union Regulation No 1151/2012 - which are obliged to take appropriate administrative and judicial measures to prevent or terminate the unlawful use of the Geographical Indications produced, protected or marketed in the Member State.1151/2012 - which are required to take appropriate administrative and judicial measures to prevent or put an end to the unlawful use of protected geographical indications produced or marketed in the Member State. This provision was strongly desired by Italy as it aimed to hold the authorities of the Member States accountable. Moreover, EU Regulation No 608/2103 ensures the customs protection of all intellectual property rights - including geographical indications - registered in the European Union.608/2103 ensures the customs protection of all intellectual property rights - including geographical indications - registered in the European Union.

In relation to the issue of product protection on the Italian market and compliance with consumer labelling requirements, I would point out that the provision of clear, understandable and legible information on food for consumer protection - a matter harmonised at European level, where EU Regulation 1169/2011 ensures a high level of consumer protection, regulating all aspects of labelling - is a matter of utmost importance and commitment for this Ministry. Finally, in relation to the issue of product protection on the Italian market and compliance with consumer protection labelling requirements, I would point out that the provision of clear, understandable and legible information on consumer food - a matter harmonised at European level, where EU Regulation 1169/2011 ensures a high level of consumer protection, regulating all aspects of labelling - is of the utmost importance and commitment for this Ministry. This is evidenced, for example, by the letter signed jointly last March by Minister Bellanova and Minister of Economic Development Stefano Patuanelli, sent to the European Commissioners for Health and Agriculture, in which Italy requested that the obligation of origin on the label be extended to all foodstuffs, starting with a quick choice on these products, which have already been tested for years on raw materials such as processed milk, pasta, tomatoes, rice, caramelized rice. This is evidenced, for example, by the letter signed jointly by Minister Bellanova and Minister of Economic Development Stefano Patuanelli last March, sent to the European Commissioners for Health and Agriculture, in which Italy requested that the obligation of origin of the raw materials on the label be extended to all foods, starting with a quick choice on products on which it has already experimented in recent years such as milk, cheeses, processed meats, pasta, rice, tomato derivatives. With this in mind, the Ministers have notified Brussels of the extension until 31 December 2021 of the Decree of 9 December 2016 on milk and cheeses and have then signed the Ministerial Decree of 1 April 2020, which also extends the mandatory provisions of indication of origin, on the label, of durum wheat for durum wheat germ paste, rice and tomato derivatives until 31 December 2021. This is in the belief that in the Farm fork to strategy the mandatory origin must be a central theme, precisely because since that phrase translates from the mandatory field to ta, the origin best explains this interpretation, so that in the label the consumer has the perception of the origin or path of traceability. This is in the belief that in the Farm to Fork strategy the compulsory origin must be a central theme, precisely because since that phrase translates from the field to the table, the compulsory origin best declines this need, so that in the label the consumer has the perception of the entire traceability path. As for the control activities, with specific reference to the one set up by the Central Inspectorate for the Protection of Quality and Fraud Prevention of Agri-Food Products (ICQRF), the latter pays the utmost attention to the verification of the indication of origin reported on agri-food products. This is also done through sample checks of traceability, to ascertain its veracity, to counter the phenomenon of Italian sounding, to protect made in Italy and the most representative productions in this area, with particular reference to those protected by specific legislation of the European Union (PDO and PGI products). Through the assistance and cooperation systems between competent authorities of the Member States of the European Union Administrative assistance and cooperation system (AAC) and Food fraud network (FF), of which the ICQRF is the contact point for Italy together with the Ministry of Health, the reports exchanged with the authorities of other Member States concerning irregularities found on labelling devices are processed. The Administrative assistance and cooperation system (AAC) and the Food Fraud Network (FF), of which the ICQRF is the contact point for Italy together with the Ministry of Health, handle the reports exchanged with the authorities of other Member States concerning irregularities detected on labelling devices. Specific memoranda of understanding have also been signed with the main online trading platforms (eBay, Amazon, Alibaba) on web-based trade, strengthening the protection of consumers using these e-commerce platforms, as well as the promotion, promotion and information on Italian PDO and PGI products, so that the phenomena of misappropriation of Italian quality designations registered on the online market are counteracted. Specific Memoranda of Understanding have also been signed with the main online trading platforms (eBay, Amazon, Alibaba) on web commerce, strengthening the protection of consumers using these e-commerce platforms, as well as the promotion, promotion and information on Italian PDO and PGI products, in order to counter the phenomena of usurpation of Italian registered quality names on the online market. In response to the questions raised by the questioner as to whether Italy's ratification of CETA - instead of representing an opportunity for our country - would, on the contrary, become a vehicle for facilitating the importation of agri-food products with lower safety standards than those in Europe, I reply by pointing out that all agri-food products coming from Canada will have to comply with European sanitary and phytosanitary legislation, including the rules governing access to genetically modified organisms and products. Similarly, due to the precautionary principle - which is enshrined in Article 191 of the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union (TFEU) and is binding and cannot be amended or repealed by any international agreement, including CETA - and sanitary and phytosanitary legislation, products treated with substances that are banned as harmful (at present, the use of glyphosate is still authorised in the European Union) or for which there is no scientific evidence of harm but a suspected risk to human health, will not be able to enter the internal market of the European Union. Therefore, while the precautionary principle remains valid, the European Union will continue to apply its legislation on the prohibition of hormones in livestock, as provided for in Directive 96/22/EC, as amended by Directive 2003/74/EC. In addition, the import of untreated meat from third countries using hormones in livestock for their internal market is only possible if the segregation of farms is ensured, which also applies to the use of antibiotics banned in the European Union, as provided for in Directive 96/23/EC. In addition, the import of untreated meat from third countries that use livestock hormones for their internal market is only possible if livestock segregation is ensured, a principle which also applies to the use of antibiotics banned in the European Union, as provided for in Directive 96/23/EC. This principle was clearly reaffirmed in the declarations annexed to the European Council procedure for the adoption of the decision authorising the signature of CETA on behalf of the Union. This principle has been clearly reaffirmed in the declarations annexed to the procedure of the European Council for the adoption of the decision authorising the signature of CETA on behalf of the Union. Finally, while specifically addressing the issue of GMOs, it should be recalled that, with the implementation of Directive 2015/412/EU, the definitive ban on the cultivation of all varieties of MON810 maize in Italy (Commission Decision No. Finally, while specifically addressing the issue of GMOs, it should be recalled that the implementation of Directive 2015/412/EU has resulted in a definitive ban on the cultivation of all MON810 maize varieties in Italy (Commission Decision No 321 of 3 March 2016) and on all GM maize still being authorised for placing on the market.321 of 3 March 2016) and of all transgenic maize still being authorised for placing on the market. The cultivation of such transgenic maize, whether authorised or authorised, shall be punishable by the penalties provided for in Article 35a of Legislative Decree No. The cultivation of such GM maize, authorised or in the process of being authorised, shall be punishable by the penalties provided for in Article 35a of Legislative Decree No 224 of 8 July 2003.224. To date, no new marketing authorisation applications have been submitted for the cultivation of new GMOs, either for maize or other species. To date, no new applications for marketing authorisation have been submitted for the cultivation of new GMOs, whether for maize or other species. The current legislative system therefore allows action on all new GMOs for which a European cultivation authorisation is applied for, while at the same time the sanctioning system is able to punish all possible cases of infringement of the rules in force. Therefore, the current legislative system enables action to be taken on all new GMOs for which a European cultivation authorisation is requested, while at the same time the sanctioning system is able to punish all possible cases of infringement of the rules in force. As regards the legislation on labelling systems for food and feed containing genetically modified organisms, it is recalled that products, whether food or feed, consisting of, containing or derived from GMOs, are subject to the labelling and traceability requirements laid down in Community Regulations (EC) No 1829/2003 and (EC) No 1829/2003. This Regulation shall enter into force on the twentieth day following that of its publication in the Official Journal of the European Union.1830/2003. This ensures that information is provided to consumers and users of these products, enabling them to make an informed choice. This ensures that information is provided to consumers and users of such products, enabling them to make an informed choice. Regulation (EC) No 1829/2003 provides that foods derived from GMOs intended for the final consumer or food suppliers to the public are to be labelled with the statement on the presence of GMOs. Regulation (EC) No 1829/2003 provides that food derived from GMOs intended for the final consumer or food suppliers must bear on the label the statement on the presence of GMOs. In addition, Regulation No 1830 of 2003 also requires genetically modified food to comply with the requirements on traceability, defined as the ability to trace GMOs and products derived from GMOs at all stages from placing on the market through the production and distribution chain. To ensure traceability, operators handling products containing, consisting of or produced from GMOs are required to provide specific information to the subsequent operator in the chain at all stages of production and distribution. In order to ensure traceability, operators dealing with products containing, consisting of or produced from GMOs are required to provide specific information to the subsequent operator in the chain at all stages of production and distribution.

              " 0: [\"It is true that Italy's role has also helped Europe to improve, to no longer be only attentive to stability and accounts but to understand that now is the time to invest in social, labour, the green new deal, the new generations. Do we really think that we would get so many resources and so much credit with an anti-European sovereignist government?Mr President-in-Office, the Government then faced an unprecedented difficulty, one that no executive in Italy had ever faced before. We acknowledge this to you and the entire government. Let's end this with the narrative of a failed government on the pandemic. It is true that the death toll in Italy is high, but can anyone blame it on the executive's handling of the pandemic?There are weaknesses in healthcare that relate to previous periods and there has been a spread of the virus that hardly any government measure could have imagined or stopped. I therefore believe that in the pandemic emergency the Government, despite the mistakes that each of us could have made, has behaved with dignity and honour. Now, Mr President of the Council, with this confidence that we renew, we also ask you to go ahead and do so for a new and strong start, defining the political perimeter of a renewed majority, which must be strong and cohesive, with that pact of legislature that you mentioned in your speech. You said that many things could be done during the current parliamentary term and I would endorse all of them, but I would like to emphasize in particular the theme of institutional reforms, because it is nothing more than making the State work well; talking about the rules of the game, how the State works, what the relationship between the State and the Regions is is essential if all the other reforms, in a cascade, are to work, so it is a very important part. The first measures announced by Biden really show a change of pace compared to what Trump did; in particular, I am referring to that multilateralism that has always been a hallmark of Italian politics, in which we believe deeply. Finally, I make a request to all of us, but especially to the Government. We need to make sure that what we say is effective and timely in affecting people's lives. This is fundamental. I understand that there are a lot of difficulties, but I think it must be a real daily grind for those who are in government today. I conclude with important words from a biblical book, the Qohelet, which however seem to me very appropriate at this stage: There is a time to be born and a time to die, a time to plant and a time to uproot what has been planted, a time to demolish and a time to build. As the President of the Republic said, this must be the time of the builders and the PD will continue to do its part.\",\n",
              "  \"Italy is first in the administration of vaccines and having achieved this is a very important result, having achieved so much in the allocation of the recovery fund is an epochal result; the issuance of a loan with common debt securities guaranteed by the Union is finally approaching the idea of a shared debt. Even two years ago, dear colleagues, we fought for a deviation of 0.4 percent of the deficit-to-GDP ratio, now instead we are called to bring home the recovery plan, which is the largest investment of our country's economic resources since World War II, a real Marshall plan. This additional emergency measure, necessary to deal with the health emergency, does not need the instrumental use of sound prejudicial instruments, but now make a robust and decent majority, and improve - to our semi-legislative examination. The preliminary ruling uses the usual argument of the illegitimacy of the decrees of the President of the Council of Ministers, but the Constitution, as you well know, allows for rules of principle in a decree and detailed rules in the DPCM, so there is nothing illegitimate. The DPCMs were used as exceptional means in an exceptional moment, but always within the scope of the Charter. By extending the state of emergency, we provide the Government with all the necessary tools to act promptly and effectively. To those who accused us of being against Europe until yesterday, we have shown that we were against that Europe, the Europe of accounting rigidity, of austerity, the Europe which regarded subsidies as a waste of public money and which instead now has recourse to public support for the economy, as you well know, and to citizens who are also your citizens, not only ours, through restaurants throughout Europe. All this cannot be lost now. Now more than ever the country needs solid leadership, an uncompromising unity between the government forces and the vigilant yet collaborative gaze of the opposition, because on this unity, today more than ever, the fate of the whole of Italy depends. We need the strength to make other important and difficult choices and to support those already made. Hence the need to have the help of all the men and women of good will in this Assembly, as President Conte called for yesterday. Otherwise, the price to be paid could be too high and the political and social consequences unpredictable. The Italian people have shown patience in respecting the strict rules that the pandemic has imposed and the various restrictions on personal freedom, but could they endure a government crisis at the same time?We have just seen what has happened in a great democracy like the United States when only the appearance of an illegitimate power has emerged. The weakness of politics at the moment would provide in Italy life-blood to anti-democratic impulses that, although creeping in our society, we see that they always survive, if we are able to look beyond the windows of these buildings. Perhaps, against all this, the only barrier will be ours and your seriousness, credibility and I also add consistency in presenting us to the country with concrete ideas and results in the exclusive interest of the citizens. School, health, work and business are all waiting. How can we be divided on these issues?I don't think so and I don't agree. The vote of the Assembly today, like yesterday's but also like future ones, will put each of you in front of your own responsibilities, before the country and before history. The extension of the state of emergency and the adoption of all necessary measures to contain the spread of the epidemic is based on facts related to the evolution of the pandemic and the worrying increase in positive cases and deaths. Never have politics and science gone so well together as now. So is the vote.\",\n",

Mr Minister, we have also heard about your new agreement with general practitioners: very good, because they are our first interlocutors, so if they too have the opportunity to be vaccinated and to vaccinate, let us add additional forces. And I also think of military healthcare as the Red Cross: welcome anyone who can help, because time is of the essence. And why is it?And why is that?

First of all, Mr Zaffini said that in Europe we did everything wrong. I say that it is not at all so, as the scientists we have heard from in the Commission have also acknowledged. To the specific question about what we did wrong, they said: what could people do who didn't know which way to go. So it was done very well; obviously corrections needed to be made, but we didn't know what to expect. So it was done very well; obviously we need to make corrections, but we didn't know what to expect. So I have to say that, both in terms of the vaccination campaign that we are facing, and also in terms of what has been done before in the emergency, we have all tried. Other European countries are no better off than we are. As we know, we are now among the first regions in Europe to vaccinate, so we can also address this emergency. As we know, we are now among the first regions in Europe to vaccinate, so we can also address this emergency. As I said a moment ago, we are all aware that, compared to the needs of the economy and trade, people's health comes first, and only by limiting the causes of the epidemic will we be able to promote economic recovery, which we really need. As I said before, we are all aware that, in relation to the needs of the economy and trade, people's health comes first and, only by limiting the causes of the epidemic, we will be able to promote economic recovery, and we really need it. In all this, the fastest possible administration of the vaccine can allow us to return to normalcy in a short time, so it is right to immunize all health workers - as has been said, they are those who face the virus in the front row - as well as the weaker categories, arriving - as the National Vaccine Plan says very well - to vaccinate other categories, planning to anticipate the vaccination for teachers to promote the reopening of schools, which Senator I spoke very well about earlier, as many other colleagues have done. In all this, the fastest possible administration of the vaccine can allow us to return to normalcy in a short time, so it is right to immunize all health workers - as has been said, they are the ones facing the virus in the front row - as well as the weaker categories, arriving - as the National Vaccine Plan says very well - to vaccinate other categories as well, anticipating the vaccination for teachers to promote the reopening of schools, which Senator Iori has spoken very well before, as many other colleagues have done. If it is true, in fact, that we need to get people out of hospitals and lighten our healthcare facilities, we believe that school is another fundamental and important factor. While it is true that we need to get people out of hospitals and lighten our healthcare facilities, we believe that school is another fundamental and important factor. It is really about the health of our young people, including the mental discomfort they are experiencing right now. It is therefore a question of finding an adaptive strategy for pandemic planning and vaccination. Professor Brusaferro said that it will be necessary to assess situations and vaccinate in case of outbreaks. I am also thinking of other sectors, starting with transport, which must not only be reorganised; we must also think of transport operators, as well as the prison staff themselves, who are helping us at this time. I am also thinking of other sectors, starting with transport, which must not only be reorganised; we must also think of transport operators, as well as the prison staff themselves, who are helping us at this time. It is therefore - I repeat - a question of adapting in a flexible way what is a plan that we all know and which is very important to follow. Mr Minister, I would add that citizens are now very, very tested, and I am also thinking of their mental health, which I have just mentioned when I speak of young people. It is also important to address this aspect, which is not insignificant, because the psychological health of individuals is the psychological health of society as a whole, which is essential for maintaining it. As I feel and as I think we all see, people are starting to feel some resentment about what is happening. It is therefore essential that attention is also paid to psychological health, an important aspect which I therefore ask you to take into account. I think the prospects for another coming vaccine, in addition to the two we've already had, are super-encouraging signals. I think the prospects of another vaccine coming, in addition to the two we already have, are super-encouraging signals.

We have seen that Europe has been good and united in this: we have all acted together for the acquisition of vaccines and I am convinced that we must also learn from these signals. We need to be patient and have confidence, a lot of confidence, even and above all in science and investing especially in research: this is another message that this pandemic is giving us. Let us see what we have achieved in a short time, thanks to the innovative technology of the vaccines that have been studied. Mr. Minister, we once again give you confidence by voting in favour of the motion for a resolution that we have tabled. Mr President, we are voting in favour of the motion for a resolution which we have tabled. I believe, however, that common sense and citizens' responsibility, for which I am grateful, must continue to play a key role in this important game which is all about health.\"],\n",
              " 1: [\"GRASSI (L-SP-PSd'Az). - (IT) Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I have the honour to recall in this Chamber, on behalf of my party, Emanuele Macaluso, who died yesterday at the age of 97. Just a few weeks ago he finished revising the drafts of his latest book Communists in our own way, which will be published soon. It is not uncommon for the luckiest and most brilliant minds, precisely because they are so, to remain efficient until the end and Emanuele Macaluso, dismissing his last book at the extraordinary age of ninety-seven, allows us to continue the dialogue with him, even after his demise. The fourth cover story tells us that a hundred years after the founding of the Communist Party, Emanuele Macaluso and Claudio Petruccioli retrace its epochal twists and turns, recalling the social achievements of which he was the promoter and hypothesizing alternative roads that Italy could have taken to avert the political and cultural decline of the country. Macaluso courageously joins the Communist Party when in Italy fascism is still in power and throughout his life he will remain faithful to his initial choice. I said faithful and not coherent because the art of politics requires you to adapt your thinking and actions to an uncontrollable variable which is the evolution of human societies. Macaluso was one of those who felt the need to make the Italian left part of Italian politics, even when history had shown that the doctrine of Marxism as a doctrine of the State had ended and exhausted its propulsive drive. Of those ideas he continued to defend its values although aware that the means had to change. Effectively, Salvatore Veca defined improvism as the internal political current in the Italian Communist Party of which Macaluso, along with Napolitano and Chiaromonte, was one of the theorists; a current that advocated the need not just to break down capitalism, but to counter it to mitigate its tendency to overwhelm the human person and make it just a market factor. Emanuele Macaluso, with his figure, reminds us that in politics there are opponents and not enemies and it is this idea that Italy needs today more than ever.\",\n",
              "  'SBROLLINI (IV-PSI). - (IT) Mr President, I thank you for your words and I thank President Casini for his words. With the death of Emanuele Macaluso we lose a piece of reformist history of the Italian left; we lose, as has already been said, an anticonformist spirit, a reformer. We lose a person who really gave his whole life to politics, first in the trade union and in journalism, then as a leader of the Italian Communist Party; a man passionate and free in his lucid political analysis, until the last day, until the last moment. I re-read the last interviews he gave recently; he said it was difficult to live in these times of pandemic, that he had never seen a country like this. He, who had lived through the years of war, the bombings, the years of terrorism, said that war and terrorism can be reacted to; but to the pandemic how can we react?We can only remain locked inside our homes, separated from others and forced to fight fear by being alone. As he rightly said in this recent interview, we know how much we are suffering because of this situation that takes away from us any relationship life, the social life to which we are accustomed; but that loneliness and that silence of which Macaluso spoke in the last interviews were the opposite of his political life, that of a great personality who marked the history of Italian politics and the left, a secular and critical conscience. Macaluso was an awkward man, as was mentioned earlier, but he was always attentive and protective towards the young, towards the new generations, as he was strict with the entire ruling class and current politics. He often said that politics today is weak: it is a politics without a vision is not able to solve problems. I would like to remember him as a politician who was able to make himself heard, even in the most difficult moments, a man who fortunately left behind a legacy of values, history, writings and books; a reference for all. We need high political thinking, a vision for today and tomorrow; we need places for discussion and debate. Only in this way will we play our role well, even today, as parliamentarians, and our function in society. Mr President, we need a reformist culture and we must play this role today with a great sense of responsibility. On behalf of the Viva Italia Group, we extend our deepest condolences to his family, his wife Enza, his son Antonio and his beloved grandchildren. We have lost a great man, but fortunately we still have a great cultural heritage. We really hope, with the stimulus we can give from this important place of political discussion and confrontation, to invite the new generations to read his books, to reflect and deepen, as it should be.',\n",

Macaluso was and was born as a communist in very difficult years, with a rebellious and combative spirit, obviously attentive, as the communists were then, to social needs and to workers' and trade union struggles. At the same time, he had an extraordinary intellectual vitality, which he maintained until the last day of his life, aware as few that man is above all a foundry of ideas and lives as he expresses his own.

              " 3: ['VITALI (FIBP-UDC). Mr. President, ladies and gentlemen representatives of the Government, honourable colleagues, the Decree-Law No.2 of 14 January 2021 extends the state of emergency until 30 April 2021, confirming the ban on movement between regions and provinces from 16 January to 15 February; extends until 30 April 2021 the possibility of the President of the Council to proceed with DPCM and delegates the Minister of Health to identify, with a series of parameters, some white zones in which restrictions can be relaxed; and, again, provides for the establishment of a computerized platform that can be used to regulate the vaccination plan. We are faced with yet another decree-law, with the disproportionate use of the emergency decree, which forgets that our Constitution does not provide a special right to the state of emergency, as is evident in other constitutions (the French, the Spanish or the Hungarian). In addition, I am reminded of the information of the President of the Council of 21 May 2020, which I want to read - you will forgive me - because from it we start our considerations. At that time the President of the Council said: We cannot afford to prolong the effectiveness of restrictive measures indefinitely. In fact, a liberal and democratic order cannot tolerate a reduction in fundamental rights, except to the extent strictly necessary to protect the basic goods of life and health of citizens, in the face of a serious and present threat. At a time when unlimited fundamental constitutional rights are being violated, administrative measures such as the decrees of the President of the Council cannot be used indiscriminately. We are no longer facing an emergency. I would like to remind you that this pandemic started in January 2020; it has been a year and I do not think that the government has shown that it has clear ideas at the time when it should have taken not only preventive measures, but also measures to support the economy.',\n",
              "  \"BOLDRINI (PD). - (IT) Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, we believe that the question referred for a preliminary ruling is based on profoundly erroneous and pretentious considerations. I remember, however, that Minister Speranza also came last week, on 13 January, to explain the whole DPCM. In our view, therefore, the Government has always acted and continues to act in compliance with the fundamental principles of the ordering and hierarchy of the sources of law. On the extension of the state of emergency, in fact, the decree-law in conversion limits itself, correctly, to adapting the framework of the primary sources, which already regulate the measures to cope with the epidemiological emergency, to the specific needs that led to this extension. We all know the needs that led to this extension, with the epidemic still ongoing, not only from us, but also in other countries. I do not necessarily want to use the example of other countries, but it should be remembered that many other countries have resorted to a complete lockdown, which we are trying to avoid as much as possible. In addition, the Government, through Minister Esperanza, has previously explained to Parliament the reasons why it has become necessary to extend the state of emergency, in compliance with the provisions of Article 2, paragraph 1, of Decree-Law 25 March 2020, n.19, according to which: The President of the Council of Ministers or a Minister delegated by him explains in advance to the Houses the content of the measures to be taken (...), in order to take account of any guidelines drawn up by the Commission . I would therefore remind you that on that occasion we tabled a majority resolution, which contained indications, which we saw later in the DPCM, including that of \\x91favouring the full resumption of teaching activities in attendance\\x92 (you have seen that, in fact, schools are gradually resuming), and of \\x91preparing, in agreement with the regions and the autonomous provinces, an adequate transport plan\\x92 (you can see how many meetings are being held, together with the regions, the State-Regions Conference and the Minister for Regional Affairs and Autonomy on this matter). We must also pay attention, because some of the things that need to be done - we must remember this - are also the responsibility of other bodies. In addition, this resolution has also served to include in the decree-law that we will have to convert an initiative aimed at ensuring the fastest implementation of the strategic plan for vaccines. You have indeed seen how the issue of vaccines continues to be important and urgent. Returning to what is said in the question, the extension of the state of emergency establishes the deadline of 30 April, given the worrying trend of the epidemiological emergency from Covid and in compliance with the provisions of the Civil Protection code; I remind colleagues that as far as the Civil Protection code is concerned, the same code was used in the event of earthquakes, just to be able to continue to extend the state of emergency, if not all the necessary activities have been done to keep people safe. Similarly, the state of emergency was extended, making use of the legislative decree of 2 January 2018, n.1, to confirm that the state of emergency is not a rule: in fact it was extended until 30 April, not always, as you claim in the preliminary question. This fact has been overcome. Therefore, the primary regulatory framework has been respected and no constitutional censorship can be imposed on the work of the Government. The decree-law is not a special law, nor an edict, as is the decree-law of 14 January 2021, n.2, which we are translating into law, which finds its legitimacy in a source of primary rank. There is really no reason to call the measures adopted so far in full respect of the role of Parliament illegitimate. In fact, Minister Speranza has come again and again to tell us what the epidemiological situation is and what measures they should have taken, of course always in full harmony with what science says. Some changes have been made, of course, but also because the epidemiological evolution has affected so much in this period; no one knew how things would go and we obviously have to adjust the shot every time we are faced with an emergency. By the way, colleagues, I remind you that not all of our citizens are complaining. I have spoken to many people who told me that if we have to make another effort, we are doing it precisely because we want to be freer later, without the virus. So we believe that, given the emergency, we must continue to apply the highest level of caution, first of all ourselves who must set an example; not like those who went to dinner in restaurants to join the #ioapro protest. Overall, we need to mitigate the risk of an uncontrolled outbreak and the increased pressure on health facilities. I remind you that even now, unfortunately, the numbers weigh on health facilities; health professionals are asking us to be careful, because they can't take it anymore. So, out of respect for them, we need to move forward with these measures. We believe that, as a consequence, an extension of the current state of emergency is necessary, as provided for in the decree of the President of the Council of Ministers, in order to allow the adoption and implementation of measures to contain the spread of the virus. We are doing what needs to be done for our citizens and I believe that, for the last time, we must do it with this DPCM. Are we sure that we will be able to get out of this situation perfectly?I very much hope so, but we must do so with all the necessary tools. The Group of the Democratic Party therefore rejects the question referred for a preliminary ruling on the constitutionality of Bill No 2066.\",\n",

Mr President, the Senate is called today to convert the latest decree-law issued by the Government to deal with the health crisis into a law. The measure is part of a complex sequence of normative acts, often difficult to understand by citizens, given their overlap and the continuing contradiction between the different texts designed to deal with the epidemic. The measure is part of a complex sequence of normative acts, often difficult to understand by citizens, given their overlap and the continuing contradiction between the different texts designed to deal with the epidemic. The decree-law was issued simultaneously with respect to yet another DPCM, a legal source largely unknown until a few months ago and has now become the cornerstone of national standardisation; a subordinate form, often improperly taken to the primary rank, for the regulation of such a delicate matter as personal freedom; a mode of production on which, as Italia Viva, we have already repeatedly expressed our perplexities; perplexities that we can summarize in the fact that the Parliament has been called, most of the time, to convert into another decree-law that did not make a subordinate source of which the decree of the President of the Council of Ministers is already a source. The decree-law was issued at the same time as yet another DPCM, a legal source largely unknown until a few months ago and which has now become the cornerstone of national regulation; a subordinate form, often improperly placed in the first place, for the regulation of such a delicate matter as personal freedom; a mode of regulatory production on which, as Italia Viva, we have already repeatedly expressed our perplexities; perplexities which we can summarize in the fact that Parliament has been called, most of the time, to convert into law a decree-law that did nothing but propose in turn a subordinate source such as the decree of the President of the Council of Ministers. First of all, there is a first criticism: there is still a desire to regulate sensitive issues, such as personal liberty, through a source subordinate to what the Constitution otherwise prescribes, as a matter on which the parliamentary legislative reserve should instead be absolute. Moreover, such legislative production, confusing in terms of the hierarchy of sources, also has problematic consequences on the parliamentary agenda, relegating Parliament to an ancillary role in relation to decisions taken elsewhere. Moreover, such legislative production, which is confusing in terms of the hierarchy of sources, also has problematic consequences for parliamentary work, relegating Parliament to an ancillary role in relation to decisions taken in other bodies. With Decree-Law No. 19 of 2020, for example, the President of the Council of Ministers provided for the possibility of managing the complex phase of the health emergency by admitting in fact - through a primary source - that the Head of the Executive can intervene through a secondary source, arriving at establishing limitations on personal freedom, for which the regulation is subject to an absolute reservation of law.19 of 2020 was - for example - provided the possibility, by the President of the Council of Ministers, to manage the complex phase of the health emergency by admitting in fact - through a primary source - that the Head of the Executive can intervene through a secondary source, arriving at establishing limitations of personal freedom, for which discipline is an absolute reservation of law. On the basis of this postulate of the hierarchy of sources, a subordinate source cannot affect restrictions on personal freedom. On the contrary, already for some time, in the current emergency phase, we have been witnessing regulatory interventions on this matter, through decrees of the President of the Council, which are certainly not attributable to the level of the primary source. On the contrary, for some time now, in the current emergency phase, we have been witnessing legislative interventions on this matter, through decrees by the President of the Council, which are certainly not attributable to the level of the primary source. On this subject Parliament, as we have already noted in the Committee on Constitutional Affairs, should reflect in depth, perhaps in order to propose a reform of the system, because a serious question arises: how can Parliament, in the context of an amendment, amend a subordinate source such as that contained in a DPCM, when the source is not properly transcribed in the decree-law?On several occasions, amendments seeking to amend the decree of the President of the Council of Ministers have been declared inadmissible, because they amend a source subordinate to the law. On several occasions, amendments seeking to amend the decree of the President of the Council of Ministers have been declared inadmissible, because they are amendments from a source subordinate to the law. This is an unprecedented and dangerous mode of legislative production: first, a decree is issued by the President of the Council of Ministers, which is only subsequently converted into a decree-law, which, within sixty days, Parliament is called upon to convert. In other words, there is an unprecedented and dangerous mode of legislative production: first, a decree is issued by the President of the Council of Ministers, which is only subsequently converted into a decree-law, which, within 60 days, Parliament is called upon to convert. However, the parts outside the decree-law, but contained in the DPCM, remain excluded from the examination, because they are not aligned with the hierarchy of sources. In essence, this is a double vulnus to the role of Parliament, which is increasingly a spectator in relation to emergency management. For this reason, the Italia Viva Group cannot but raise serious concerns about this mode of legislative production. We therefore call for a reform of the system, which sees a more central role for Parliament in emergency management, and I therefore announce a vote of abstention, on behalf of the Group.

              " 7: [\"ROSSOMANDO (PD). - (PT) Mr President, ladies and gentlemen of the Government, ladies and gentlemen, in our country 9 per cent of women have been physically harassed or sexually blackmailed while at work. If a woman is sexually blackmailed, 80 percent of the time she does not tell anyone at work; almost no one reports it, yet at least 70 percent of women who have been sexually blackmailed find it very or fairly serious.33 percent of these women have voluntarily changed jobs or quit their careers because of sexual harassment at work; 10 percent have been fired or put into a reintegration box. This is the framework under which the International Labour Organisation adopted, on 21 June 2019, the Convention on the Elimination of Violence and Harassment in the Workplace, with an overwhelming majority of Member States. Work is the place of people's rights and emancipation and I am proud that Italy will be the first of 187 Member States to ratify this Convention. Italy is a country that already has anti-discrimination and worker protection rules, but today we are approving a framework and a very innovative protection programme. I would like to emphasise the international nature of this regulatory framework. We are now accustomed to associating the word globalisation with the loss of rights and the deterioration of working conditions. We want to reverse this equation and for there to be a globalisation of rights against the exploitation of people, a globalisation no longer driven by the unregulated market and outside the cooperation of States, which too often has led to a loss of dignity for people and caused social tensions and mistrust in citizenship relations. It is therefore time for the globalisation of the rights and dignity of the person, with his freedoms and the right to freely choose his own living conditions and future. Violence and harassment in the workplace are violations of human rights and this type of violence, which translates into physical, verbal and blackmailing harassment, is unfortunately still covered by silence, silence and lack of solidarity, much more than in other cases of violence - already reprehensible. As I said, almost 90 percent of women who suffered did not report it. First of all, an expansion of the definition of violence or harassment, but above all of the place: the place of work is not only the physical place of the establishment, but it can also be the home or a place of travel and - attention - in the Covid era, at a time when there is a lot of teleworking, in which smart working is used, there has been an increase in violence both in domestic locations and through computer means, so this is very important. There is an obligation of the Member States to prescribe and the employer to adopt preventive and repressive measures and there is an obligation to guarantee access to justice, as well as a greater involvement of labour inspectors. Our country, in fact, as has been said, does not go unnoticed on this issue. I would like to recall two issues for everyone: in the 2018 budget law we introduced the prohibition on dismissal, dismissal and transfer following a complaint of sexual harassment, as well as the nullity of retaliatory dismissal or the dismissal of the complainant, in addition - of course - to the prohibition on blank dismissal. The main cause, however, lies in the power imbalance between perpetrators and victims of violence. I would like to recall the words of Guy Ryder, Director-General of the ILO, when he says that these rights must be put into practice in order to create a better, safer and more dignified working environment for women and men. We talk a lot about investment and work at this difficult time for our country, for all European democracies and worldwide. Investing in work and its quality also means investing in its dignity, which is a very important factor of social cohesion, belonging and redemption of people, because it marks the relationship between the person and the community and it is also and above all from this that being citizens and not subjects passes. For these reasons, the vote of the Democratic Party will obviously be in favour of the ratification in question, but it will above all be a vote of convinced and firm commitment to legislate on these issues and fully implement the Constitution.\",\n",
              "  'GARAVINI (IV-PSI). - (IT) Mr President, Denise was nineteen years old when she was hired by a shipping company and began to be harassed by her seventy-five-year-old employer, with advances she promptly refused, even though she had been progressively dismissed and even suffered contractual deterioration. The Convention on the Elimination of Violence and Harassment in the World of Work, adopted last June on the occasion of the centenary of the creation of the International Labour Organisation (ILO), is rightly described as a landmark ruling because it represents a concrete step forward. First of all, it provides a broad definition of violence and harassment: a definition that includes not only physical but also verbal abuse, as well as phenomena such as stalking and mobbing, because it explicitly refers to gender-based violence and harassment that can cause physical, psychological, sexual but also economic harm. It also covers volunteers, people in training, traineeships and apprenticeships, and even those who are looking for work or workers whose relationship has been terminated. Another positive aspect is that violence or harassment is also recognised when it occurs outside the workplace, in the physical sense, and therefore includes all behaviour that occurs, for example, during business trips and social events, as well as in the context of communications that take place via telematics. This is particularly important in view of the increase in sexual harassment on new social networks such as WhatsApp, which are less formal but equally insidious. The Convention also provides for a wide range of obligations for States and, subsequently, for employers, who are no longer only able but also obliged to guarantee the protection of all those involved in the workplace. By ratifying this Convention, we are, in essence, promoting a reversal of the cultural approach and of the collective approach to the phenomenon. Among other things, obligations are foreseen for the various States, including the introduction of decisive powers for labour inspectors and other supervisory authorities. Today, it is estimated that 80 per cent of women who experience abuse at work or by their managers often do not report or talk about it just to live quietly or for fear of scandal or retaliation. However, this violence often affects those who are most vulnerable in the world of work. It is a change, a turning point. It is a question of promoting a cultural revolution which makes possible a change of pace. This is also why it is important today to ratify this Convention. I hope that the vote will bring together the different political forces, unlike what happened in the Commission, because one cannot speak of interference with national law. When it comes to protecting the dignity of workers, there must be no justification or excuse because the only interference is that which treats the body of others as if it were an object of their own property, at work and outside.',\n",
              "  \"RAUTI (FdI). - (FR) I thank you, Mr President, also because this is not just a matter for women, and if it is, we should all be concerned. I thank you, Mr President, also because this is not just about women, and if it is, we should all be concerned. I was just saying that the Convention has an approach that looks at everyone, men and women, even if in the well-known statistical evidence that women are affected more and disproportionately. I was just saying that the Convention has an approach that looks at everyone, men and women, although in the known statistical evidence that women are affected more and disproportionately. The Convention and its international standards are also the result of comparative studies of national laws and practices on violence and harassment at work in as many as 80 countries. The Convention and its international standards are also the result of comparative studies of national laws and practices on violence and harassment at work in as many as 80 countries. It is important to remember that the Convention is an international treaty with binding force, of course in the countries that decide to ratify it. It is important to remember that the Convention is an international treaty with binding force, of course in the countries that decide to ratify it. I recall that two are sufficient to begin with. Recommendation 206 in the context of the Convention is obviously not binding, but it is important in that it contains guidelines on how to apply the obligations of the Convention.206, in the context of the Convention, is obviously not binding, but it is important insofar as it contains guidelines on how to apply the obligations of the Convention. Another consideration: the Convention calls for violence and harassment in the workplace, but it also involves and seeks to address a complex array of issues, as has already been mentioned. I am referring to mobbing, stalking, psychological violence, the issue of worker protection and how to prevent and deal with violence and harassment. There is also a further step: a broad interpretation is meant precisely because it looks at a set of behaviours, practices and acts intended to cause or even threaten physical, psychological and economic harm, or which is intended to be a sexual offence or gender-based violence. There is also a further step: it is a broad interpretation precisely because it looks at a set of behaviours, practices and acts intended to cause or even threaten physical, psychological and economic harm, or which are - it is envisaged - configured as a sexual offence or as gender-based violence. Another forward-looking element of the Convention is that it is addressed to all types of workers, i.e. not only to employees, and not only to workplaces - I want to emphasize this - but also to those that I allow myself to define as not only places, which are nevertheless only connected to the world of work, i.e. for example, work trips, job training courses away from the usual workplace, but also the means of communication and information, chats, e-mails and WhatsApp, that is, all those offensive messages, which we know can be used in an invasive way, such as text messages, images and even threatening messages, as well as text messages and messages, which can be used in an aggressive way, as we well know, as text messages and even threatening messages. Another forward-looking element of the Convention is that it is addressed to all types of workers, that is to say not only to employees, and not only to workplaces - I would like to emphasize this - but also to those which I may call non-places, but which are nevertheless linked to the world of work, i.e. for example, business trips, vocational training courses away from the usual place of work, but also to the means of communication and information such as chats, text messages, e-mails, WhatsApp messages, i.e. all those tools which, as we know, can be used in an invasive, pervasive and I would even say distorting way, becoming aggressive, offensive and threatening through the transmission of video, images or text. This is why the Convention makes an effort to include them. Before concluding, I want to go back to the statistical evidence from which I started, referring to the only survey we have practically, however dated. Before concluding, I would like to return to the statistical evidence from which I started, referring to the only survey we have practically, however dated. I am referring to the 2016 Istat survey on the safety of citizens, which also addresses the chapter on violence and harassment at work and sexual blackmail. One of the statistics provided by Istat is that 1.404 million women have experienced physical harassment and sexual harassment at work in their lifetime, or 8.9 percent of the female workforce. The survey also found that over 425,000 women, or 2.7 percent, experienced these episodes in the three-year period 2013-2016. It is clear that the figures are quite different when we talk about violence outside the workplace (those I mentioned are confined to the workplace). It is clear that the figures are quite different when we talk about violence outside the workplace (those I mentioned are confined to the workplace). Cases involve physical contact, requests for sexual services or availability in exchange for a promotion or job or promotion, promotion or threat of dismissal. The Institute notes that in over 80% of cases victims do not report or tell anyone what happened to them: only 0.7% of victims do. The same Institute notes that in more than 80 per cent of cases victims do not report or tell anyone what happened to them: only 0.7 per cent of victims do. Of course, all the victims interviewed by the Istat stress that these incidents have changed their lives, both personally and professionally, because many of them have been fired or have resigned, or have not been hired or have been dismissed. Surely, however, all the victims interviewed by the Istat point out that these incidents have changed their lives, both personal and professional, because many of them have been fired or have resigned, or have not been hired or have been dismissed. The Fratelli d'Italia Group, both here in the Senate and in the Chamber, will therefore vote convincingly in favour of this measure. The Fratelli d'Italia Group, both here in the Senate and in the Chamber, will therefore vote with conviction in favour of this measure. We do so with conviction - even if, under certain conditions, we might disagree on something - because this is one of those cases where you have to take a position: either you are on one side or you are on the other, without any mediation. We do so with conviction - even if, within certain premises, we might disagree on something - because this is one of those cases where you have to take a stand: either you are on one side or you are on the other, without any mediation.\"]}"
