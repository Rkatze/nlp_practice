For two terms in the House, she was a reference on this subject, but, beyond the political sensitivity that led her to work to support culture and make it accessible to everyone, Emilia really understood culture, music and theatre: she had so much to teach about this and this sensitivity gave her the opportunity to cultivate so many relationships and to get in touch with worlds often far from politics.

In this branch of Parliament Emilia then worked for an entire term as President of the Health Committee: she did so while important and controversial issues were being discussed.

For some years she attended the Municipality of Gaby in the Gressoney valley and on those occasions I had the pleasure of accompanying her to visit the socio-health facilities of my Region, always showing her great attention to the provision of services in the territories, and to host her also on the occasion of conferences in which she participated with competence and passion. I remember that, when we met here in the Senate, she greeted me with a  Bonjour, monsieur le sénateur , as I am called in my country, with a rotating R that made the French impeccable. I would like to mention briefly how important your political work and your role as President of the Health Committee were in enabling the adoption of important laws such as the one on the reorganisation of the health professions, the one containing provisions on the safety of health care for citizens and on the professional responsibility of health professionals.

I am referring to definitely different experiences; when I met Emilia I was first a militant and then a young party leader, while Emilia had already accumulated a long political experience, on the territory and also at the national level. But she was crossed by the awareness that one of the functions of political communities and parties should be to identify and select the ruling class and to make it grow, in a relationship between generations that had to be frank and dialectical. I say this with a smile, because those who know Emilia know what it means to have a dialectical relationship with her (using a euphemism, of course). This relationship was always centered on the awareness that the ruling classes do not fall from the sky, but are the result of a patient and constant construction, of a relationship and a confrontation, even between representatives of different generations and different paths. I owe a lot to Emilia also from this point of view. She thought that there were no battles for women, battles for LGBT rights, battles for childhood, battles for fragility, but that each battle lived on the strength of battles for others and that strengthening the rights of each meant strengthening the rights of all others. This was her thought, this was her conviction and I believe that the debt we owe to a personality, with a figure like Emilia is exactly this: to understand, in the new world we are entering, the importance of this kind of reflection, which she naturally made live in the exercise of her parliamentary function and in her political initiative. She did so as President of the Commission for Health and Hygiene, but she did so in general in her struggles, so we will miss her thinking, her initiative, her expertise in this very difficult time we are going through. We will also miss that smile and that overwhelming laughter that was noticeable every time we confronted her and that was the conclusion of any confrontation, even the harshest. Thank you Emilia, we will miss you very much.\\n',\n",

These are the four words that I have in my heart and that she defended without fear in front of anyone.

A very thorough knowledge survey was carried out on the sustainability of the health system. The results of this paper are still very relevant today - indeed, especially today.

I had the opportunity and the honour of being with her in the 16th Parliament in the 7th Commission, so that I could grasp all the aspects of her personality: the aspect of a Member who went into detail about every measure, as well as her polemical vis. I remember, in moments of great tension, her sharp words, which I think are unforgettable for everyone. She was incredible and did not give up because she always had to bring the comparison of ideas to the end. I remember her attitude always very serious and responsible and the love that shone even from the treatment of the various measures; a great love for culture in any form, be it music, books, publishing or her blog on rock. She was truly multifaceted, with an extraordinary enthusiasm and a desire to live every moment with great intensity. I think her characteristic was exactly this: her enthusiasm for life and her work and her desire to also participate in the battles for gender equality and against violence against women, which I assure you were not so easy then as they are today. We also had a lot of discussions on this subject. On other matters we had very different views, but we never lacked respect and esteem. As we all know, in the end you live more with your colleagues in the Commission than with your family. It was a constructive relationship because, as has already been said, Emilia also liked to compare and there was always a way of communicating and learning from each other, an attitude - this - which I really like and try to practice every day. On behalf of the League-Salvini Premier-Sardinian Action Party Group, I would therefore like to offer my condolences to the family and colleagues and friends of the Democratic Party Group, who with Emilia lose not only a friend, but a fundamental component, for how she wanted to live her political passion, 100 percent, but also all the other aspects of life.\\n\",\n",

First a member of the PCI, to which she gave her contribution, for its transformation and for the construction of the PDS and then, gradually, up to the founding manifesto of the PD. She was a municipal councillor in Milan for the PDS, twice deputy, in the XV and XVI legislature and then senator in the XVII legislature. She said: Women, culture, information and work are the four words that are close to my heart and in fact her action has always been directed at the defence of women, their rights, gender equality in every sphere, whether in the family, at work, in society and in political life. In the cultural sphere, her contribution has been tangible, as demonstrated by the approval of the law on live entertainment, but also the law on fair remuneration for freelance journalists, the reform of publishing, tax relief measures for cinema and the recognition of unemployment benefits for artists. As her colleagues recalled, she was Chair of the Senate's Hygiene and Health Commission in the last legislature and in this field she has also made a tangible and concrete contribution, working to achieve important progress on civilization and respect for the dignity of patients. I am referring in particular to advance treatment arrangements, an issue which in Italy is always particularly sensitive, to informed consent and to the responsibility of healthcare professionals. She has also committed herself to the approval of the reform of the health professions, to the strengthening and modernisation of the National Health Service, to ensuring its universality and fairness, especially towards the most vulnerable groups. It can be said with certainty that she has always worked for the enhancement of what we might call the human capital of our National Health Service and to promote dialogue and discussion between institutions and organisations of citizens and patients. It is precisely because of her unwavering commitment to health that she received, in 2016, from the GIMBE Foundation, the award entitled Let's save our national health service. Some choices have divided us, as is normal and as happens in politics, but I can say with confidence that, with the death of Emilia De Biasi, we lose a woman who dedicated her life to others and politics, always attentive to the needs of citizens and to respect and strengthening the republican institutions.\\n\",\n",

The Convention on the Elimination of Violence and Harassment in the World of Work, adopted last June on the occasion of the centenary of the creation of the International Labour Organisation (ILO), is rightly described as a landmark ruling because it represents a concrete step forward. First of all, it provides a broad definition of violence and harassment: a definition that includes not only physical but also verbal abuse, as well as phenomena such as stalking and mobbing, because it explicitly refers to gender-based violence and harassment that can cause physical, psychological, sexual but also economic harm. It also covers volunteers, people in training, traineeships and apprenticeships, and even those who are looking for work or workers whose relationship has been terminated. Another positive aspect is that violence or harassment is also recognised when it occurs outside the workplace, in the physical sense, and therefore includes all behaviour that occurs, for example, during business trips and social events, as well as in the context of communications that take place via telematics. This is particularly important in view of the increase in sexual harassment on new social networks such as WhatsApp, which are less formal but equally insidious. The Convention also provides for a wide range of obligations for States and, subsequently, for employers, who are no longer only able but also obliged to guarantee the protection of all those involved in the workplace. By ratifying this Convention, we are, in essence, promoting a reversal of the cultural approach and of the collective approach to the phenomenon. Among other things, obligations are foreseen for the various States, including the introduction of decisive powers for labour inspectors and other supervisory authorities. Today, it is estimated that 80 per cent of women who experience abuse at work or by their managers often do not report or talk about it just to live quietly or for fear of scandal or retaliation. However, this violence often affects those who are most vulnerable in the world of work. It is a change, a turning point. It is a question of promoting a cultural revolution which makes possible a change of pace. This is also why it is important today to ratify this Convention. I hope that the vote will bring together the different political forces, unlike what happened in the Commission, because one cannot speak of interference with national law. When it comes to protecting the dignity of workers, there must be no justification or excuse because the only interference is that which treats the body of others as if it were an object of their own property, at work and outside.\\n',\n",

Another consideration: the Convention calls for violence and harassment in the workplace, but it also involves and seeks to address a complex array of issues, as has already been mentioned. I am referring to mobbing, stalking, psychological violence, the issue of worker protection and how to prevent and deal with violence and harassment. There is also a further step: a broad interpretation is meant precisely because it looks at a set of behaviours, practices and acts intended to cause or even threaten physical, psychological and economic harm, or which is intended to be a sexual offence or gender-based violence. There is also a further step: it is a broad interpretation precisely because it looks at a set of behaviours, practices and acts intended to cause or even threaten physical, psychological and economic harm, or which are - it is envisaged - configured as a sexual offence or as gender-based violence. Another forward-looking element of the Convention is that it is addressed to all types of workers, i.e. not only to employees, and not only to workplaces - I want to emphasize this - but also to those that I allow myself to define as not only places, which are nevertheless only connected to the world of work, i.e. for example, work trips, job training courses away from the usual workplace, but also the means of communication and information, chats, e-mails and WhatsApp, that is, all those offensive messages, which we know can be used in an invasive way, such as text messages, images and even threatening messages, as well as text messages and messages, which can be used in an aggressive way, as we well know, as text messages and even threatening messages. Another forward-looking element of the Convention is that it is addressed to all types of workers, that is to say not only to employees, and not only to workplaces - I would like to emphasize this - but also to those which I may call non-places, but which are nevertheless linked to the world of work, i.e. for example, business trips, vocational training courses away from the usual place of work, but also to the means of communication and information such as chats, text messages, e-mails, WhatsApp messages, i.e. all those tools which, as we know, can be used in an invasive, pervasive and I would even say distorting way, becoming aggressive, offensive and threatening through the transmission of video, images or text. This is why the Convention makes an effort to include them. Before concluding, I want to go back to the statistical evidence from which I started, referring to the only survey we have practically, however dated. Before concluding, I would like to return to the statistical evidence from which I started, referring to the only survey we have practically, however dated. I am referring to the 2016 Istat survey on the safety of citizens, which also addresses the chapter on violence and harassment at work and sexual blackmail. One of the statistics provided by Istat is that 1.404 million women have experienced physical harassment and sexual harassment at work in their lifetime, or 8.9 percent of the female workforce. The survey also found that over 425,000 women, or 2.7 percent, experienced these episodes in the three-year period 2013-2016. It is clear that the figures are quite different when we talk about violence outside the workplace (those I mentioned are confined to the workplace). It is clear that the figures are quite different when we talk about violence outside the workplace (those I mentioned are confined to the workplace). Cases involve physical contact, requests for sexual services or availability in exchange for a promotion or job or promotion, promotion or threat of dismissal. The Institute notes that in over 80% of cases victims do not report or tell anyone what happened to them: only 0.7% of victims do. The same Institute notes that in more than 80 per cent of cases victims do not report or tell anyone what happened to them: only 0.7 per cent of victims do. Of course, all the victims interviewed by the Istat stress that these incidents have changed their lives, both personally and professionally, because many of them have been fired or have resigned, or have not been hired or have been dismissed. Surely, however, all the victims interviewed by the Istat point out that these incidents have changed their lives, both personal and professional, because many of them have been fired or have resigned, or have not been hired or have been dismissed.

              " \"DE PETRIS (Misto-LeU). - (FR) Mr President, I believe that today is a very important day and frankly I regret that the House is rather distracted in discussing the ratification of this very important convention. It is a solemn undertaking that our country is taking on at this moment and is finally going to approve and ratify the Convention itself. Compared to other conventions, we have succeeded in getting it approved fairly quickly, since in this Chamber we are used to ratifying treaties signed many years before. Above all, we have to deal - this is the really important part of this ratification - with the data that my colleague before me was reminding us of. The European Union Agency's survey on violence against women says that one in two women say they have experienced some form of sexual harassment at work. In 32 per cent of cases the harasser is a colleague, a subordinate or a superior, and these figures are dramatic. Even more dramatic are the data of the 2016 Istat survey, which shows that in Italy there are 1,400,000 women affected by forms of harassment, violence, blackmail and other forms of sexual blackmail. When women are interviewed, when they are selected, the first thing they are asked is whether they intend to have children. This is the other element of deep discrimination. This occurs at the time of recruitment, but also during the career, with all that goes with it. 32.4% of these blackmailings are repeated daily; 17.4% about once a week; 29.4% sometimes a month and 19.2% more rarely. If we then read these figures on the basis of the fact that in our country we have a very high female employment deficit (18% less than male employment, which unfortunately, as we know, is what it is these days), we are faced with a really dramatic figure. Eighty-one per cent of the victims interviewed never spoke about it and less than one per cent then had the courage to report what had happened or managed to find some form of socialization. That is why I say that ratifying the Convention in question today is of fundamental importance, because thanks to it we have at our disposal a real tool in the fight against violence and harassment committed in the world of work, we are doing a fundamental act to support women and anyone who is subjected to this kind of blackmail in the workplace and above all to give them the possibility and the force of respect for their dignity. Let us think about the figures I told you about earlier, about how many women are forced to change jobs and quit or have been fired. The scope is precisely the protection of workers, irrespective of their contractual status, in a world of work which is so fragmented and changing, and in which there are now so many different forms of work. This includes volunteers, trainees, trainees, apprentices and jobseekers: there is therefore a very wide range of protection. The Convention provides for a wide range of protection and prevention measures, with obligations on States, and therefore on our State, to adopt all internal provisions defining violence and harassment and all measures to prevent these harmful behaviours, including from a compensatory and repressive point of view. This means that it requires States to ensure that potential victims have effective access to justice, by preparing measures to remedy them. The Convention devotes particular attention to gender-based violence and above all seeks to do political and cultural advocacy and training work; this is the other fundamental element. Today we are about to approve - I am sure, unanimously - a very important ratification, a very important ratification. Of course, we all hope - because I think we all agree on this - that we will be able to make the best use of this instrument, including the obligation it imposes on the State to adopt all the acts and legislative provisions which make it possible to extend the system of protection and, above all, to prevent.\\n\",\n",

              " \"ROSSOMANDO (PD). - (PT) Mr President, ladies and gentlemen of the Government, ladies and gentlemen, in our country 9 per cent of women have been physically harassed or sexually blackmailed while at work. If a woman is sexually blackmailed, 80 percent of the time she does not tell anyone at work; almost no one reports it, yet at least 70 percent of women who have been sexually blackmailed find it very or fairly serious.33 percent of these women have voluntarily changed jobs or quit their careers because of sexual harassment at work; 10 percent have been fired or put into a reintegration box. This is the framework under which the International Labour Organisation adopted, on 21 June 2019, the Convention on the Elimination of Violence and Harassment in the Workplace, with an overwhelming majority of Member States. Work is the place of people's rights and emancipation and I am proud that Italy will be the first of 187 Member States to ratify this Convention. Italy is a country that already has anti-discrimination and worker protection rules, but today we are approving a framework and a very innovative protection programme. I would like to emphasise the international nature of this regulatory framework. We are now accustomed to associating the word globalisation with the loss of rights and the deterioration of working conditions. We want to reverse this equation and for there to be a globalisation of rights against the exploitation of people, a globalisation no longer driven by the unregulated market and outside the cooperation of States, which too often has led to a loss of dignity for people and caused social tensions and mistrust in citizenship relations. It is therefore time for the globalisation of the rights and dignity of the person, with his freedoms and the right to freely choose his own living conditions and future. Violence and harassment in the workplace are violations of human rights and this type of violence, which translates into physical, verbal and blackmailing harassment, is unfortunately still covered by silence, silence and lack of solidarity, much more than in other cases of violence - already reprehensible. As I said, almost 90 percent of women who suffered did not report it. First of all, an expansion of the definition of violence or harassment, but above all of the place: the place of work is not only the physical place of the establishment, but it can also be the home or a place of travel and - attention - in the Covid era, at a time when there is a lot of teleworking, in which smart working is used, there has been an increase in violence both in domestic locations and through computer means, so this is very important. There is an obligation of the Member States to prescribe and the employer to adopt preventive and repressive measures and there is an obligation to guarantee access to justice, as well as a greater involvement of labour inspectors. Our country, in fact, as has been said, does not go unnoticed on this issue. I would like to recall two issues for everyone: in the 2018 budget law we introduced the prohibition on dismissal, dismissal and transfer following a complaint of sexual harassment, as well as the nullity of retaliatory dismissal or the dismissal of the complainant, in addition - of course - to the prohibition on blank dismissal. The main cause, however, lies in the power imbalance between perpetrators and victims of violence. I would like to recall the words of Guy Ryder, Director-General of the ILO, when he says that these rights must be put into practice in order to create a better, safer and more dignified working environment for women and men. We talk a lot about investment and work at this difficult time for our country, for all European democracies and worldwide. Investing in work and its quality also means investing in its dignity, which is a very important factor of social cohesion, belonging and redemption of people, because it marks the relationship between the person and the community and it is also and above all from this that being citizens and not subjects passes. For these reasons, the vote of the Democratic Party will obviously be in favour of the ratification in question, but it will above all be a vote of convinced and firm commitment to legislate on these issues and fully implement the Constitution.\\n\",\n",

Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, the measure in question concerns the authorisation to ratify and implement the Convention adopted by the International Labour Organisation on 21 June 2019 with the aim of eliminating violence and harassment in the world of work. The importance of the issue of work is the focus of our political activity. A healthy country is a country that works and, therefore, any attention that can improve the protection of workers in its work environment is an objective to be pursued. The text provides for a comprehensive framework of obligations for Member States, ranging from the adoption of internal provisions defining violence and harassment in accordance with the Convention and requiring employers to take all measures to prevent harmful behaviour, to the more general obligation for States themselves to take the necessary measures, both preventive and punitive. The Convention will then be subject to the monitoring mechanism provided for by the International Labour Organisation, first through periodic reports submitted by States. I therefore wonder, colleagues, whether there is no risk of opening up a new arena of conflict between States, based on judicial struggles, which instead conceal a real desire to attack, at the international level, an unwelcome country or government. It is also necessary to consider the power of complaint which is granted to the Board of Directors of the same Organization and even to individual delegates to the International Labour Conference, making it possible to initiate, on their own initiative, a procedure capable of leading to the creation of a Commission of Inquiry, charged with drawing up a report containing, if necessary, recommendations for the State concerned. Mr President, in conclusion, there are therefore some points of perplexity, which I wanted to express and share with colleagues. As I have already said, we are not opposed to the principles that the Convention promotes, but we have doubts about their translation into practice. Despite these points of uncertainty, given the shared objectives of this Convention, I vote in favour of the League-Salvini Premier Group-Sardinian Action Party.\\n\",\n",

This impact is staggering to say the least. Sexual harassment, violence and blackmail in the workplace: how many women are victims?It is even difficult to estimate, because there is no specific type of crime and there has never been regular and constant monitoring of this type of violence. To get an idea of this, we have to go back to the only existing Istat survey, which dates back to 2016. The figures are worrying: in fact, 1.404 million women have been physically harassed or sexually blackmailed at work during their working lives. This is one in ten women. On the other hand, 1.173 million, or 7.5%, women have been subjected to some form of sexual blackmail in the course of their working lives in order to get a job, keep a job or advance in their career. Not to mention complaints: only 0.7 per cent of victims of blackmail have reported them to law enforcement. Why, in the face of such a widespread phenomenon, are there so few complaints?For rather obvious reasons: fear of not being believed or even blamed, of losing their job or of all being in vain. Can we blame them?I would say no. Just think of the shocking case last summer when the president of the Lucan transport company, Cotrab, despite being tried and sentenced to two years and six months for sexual violence against an employee, was re-elected by the same consortium. This woman was one of the 0.7 percent of victims who found the courage to report, defied the fear of losing their jobs and not being believed, and faced a lengthy trial. The culprit is convicted, but then everything risks being thwarted by a subculture that normalizes and trivializes sexual violence at work. The episode shows that the current tools are not enough to counter this hateful phenomenon. I feel that I agree with the concern expressed, among others, by the Foundation for the Study of Labour Consultants, which highlights how the devastating effects of the COVID-19 pandemic on women's employment, such as increased job insecurity and the resulting economic and social disadvantage, can contribute to further exacerbating the phenomenon of harassment and especially blackmail in the workplace. I recall that already in 2019, the Commission on Femicide - of which I am honoured to be a member - had dedicated November 25 of that year to combating violence and harassment in the workplace, highlighting how work is a universally recognised right and, nevertheless, work itself still represents a place of inequality between men and women. We therefore welcome the achievement of today's ratification of the ILO Convention, which recognises that violence and harassment constitute a violation or abuse of human rights and recognises the right of everyone to a world of work free from violence and harassment. I would also like to emphasise that the Armed Forces are also a workplace. Women have been part of the Armed Forces for 21 years now, so it is no longer possible to postpone the introduction of the specific offences of violence and sexual harassment, even within the military penal code.\\n\",\n",

In particular, we are voting against it because we are not convinced by Article 1, which - as Senator Alfieri has pointed out - adds a further period to the preamble to the Convention; to be more precise, it adds a new recital.

What is new in the 'considered' and which we do not like is the following, namely the prediction - perhaps not all of you have read it - for which the national courts must act:] under the supervision of the European Court of Human Rights [...]. We are voting on a principle which overturns all the Italian constitutional jurisprudence that has been passed up to now.

He was the extreme offspring in Sicily of the Enlightenment; a restless investigator and above all attentive to the recovery of the context, as his favorite author, Alessandro Manzoni, taught him. He had the confidence of the Enlightenment intellectual, the analysis conducted in his own way with a bitter irony; an intention that he knew how to decline in a thousand variations in his works and articles and always aimed at the useful. He was an intellectual of whom today one feels a deep lack and need, far from conformity and from any compromise, as well as scevro from any courtiership.

Talking about the Mafia at a time when its existence was denied and its transformative and mimetic capacity within society was truly an extraordinary insight, considering the time when it was published The Day of the Owl, in 1961. And a few years after that, in 1963, the Anti-Mafia Commission was set up. He spoke of anti-mafia in the late eighties, just when anti-mafia was rising all over Italy. I refer to an article published in Corriere della sera on 10 January 1987, devoted to the relationship between politics, popularity and anti-mafia, in which he explained how anti-mafia can become a formidable tool to make a career, obtain the consent of the public and acquire credits.

From this Sciascia also makes a kind of archaeology, starting from far and precisely from the work of the prefect Mori, sent to Sicily by the fascist Government to solve the issue by military hand, which earned him the advancement of his career. He then came to his days, revealing the danger inherent in the anti-mafia, of which the most serious is to resort to it to have extraordinary powers and momentary suspension of the State of law. For Sciascia the real challenge was to defeat the mafia with ordinary tools, without indulging in authoritarian drift or delusions of omnipotence.

              " 'BOLDRINI (PD). - (IT) Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I should like to draw your attention to an incident of national importance which took place last Thursday in my constituency of Ferrara. Beyond the confidence due to the work of the police, who are investigating to understand whether it is the isolated action of an individual or if it falls into a more complex picture, I think we can not but express not only indignation, but also concern. The letter to the MEIS, even if it was sent by a fool, therefore has a precise meaning; the destination is not random, but precise, as are the offences contained. It must be said that in Ferrara there is a historic Jewish community, perfectly integrated, with which there is a deep, intense and continuous dialogue at all institutional levels. Ferrara is the city where our senator Liliana Segre came, on January 11, 2019, enchanting an audience of 700 students in a crowded theater, telling her experience of surviving Auschwitz. And it is the city where the administration, today led by a legist, wanted to grant her in the same year honorary citizenship, for the deep bond, woven in time. Ferrara is the city of Bassani, the Finzi Contini and the city of MEIS. The letter was sent in the run-up to Remembrance Day, 27 January, a commemoration of the Holocaust victims, in memory of the opening of the gates of Auschwitz on 27 January 1945. Other events have occurred elsewhere: last Sunday the presentation, via Zoom, of the book The Desert Generation by the Roman author Lia Tagliacozzo, an event promoted by the Jewish Studies Center in Turin, was interrupted. Images of Hitler were introduced, insults such as Jews in the ovens, We will burn you all, and I stop here. It is therefore a scientifically organised attack, using new digital tools. It is difficult to think of a coincidence, especially at a time when neo-Nazi impulses are awakening everywhere in Europe. We are witnessing a resurgence of hatred, typical of times of social unrest and unrest, when ideologies take root more easily, because they sink and cement themselves in the dissatisfaction and frustration of people, who are presented with an enemy to encourage their struggle against each other. If Jews have always been - as I said just now - easy targets, the pandemic crisis we are experiencing is fertile ground for cultivating and instilling further fears. I therefore ask for the commitment of all those present to monitor, guard and distance themselves from such incidents, which cannot be robbed as minor, just because they do not have devastating effects, because they are not: among the effects is the risk of emulation they generate. Trust in the police must be accompanied by a constant awareness campaign. I conclude my speech by recalling, duly, the words of the president of the MEIS and the director: The ignominious and cowardly act only increases the determination and tenacity with which the museum leads and will lead the mission assigned to it by the Italian Parliament to keep the memory alive, to fight anti-Semitism and to educate the new generations to the principles of equality and fraternity that our Constitution calls us to pursue.\\n',\n",

National legislation provides for this as a last resort waste, but in other European countries the waste from petroleum processing is kept to a minimum, as it is used as a fuel, for its high energy value. I therefore hope that the same solution can be found in Italy by making landfills useless or reducing their volume. In Verona, a request was submitted to the Veneto Region for the construction of a landfill in Sorgà, De Morta, occupying a total area of 455,000 square metres. The waste will come for 65 percent from a company in Castelnuovo del Garda and for 35 percent from a company in Lainate.

This week we see a general deterioration in the epidemiological situation in the country: RT, incidence, occupancy rate of intensive care units and outbreaks of unknown origin are increasing at the same time. To be even more precise, I report, albeit in a schematic way, the main data emerged from the last monitoring booth. Let's start with the RT: in the period between December 15 and 28, 2020, after four weeks, the RT rises again and for the first time, after six weeks, it is now above index 1. Even this data, taken individually, clearly indicates that we are very likely at a new phase change: the epidemic is again in an expansive phase. The data tell us that the RT calculated on symptomatic cases is 1.03; 3 regions have a point RT greater than 1 even in the lower value; 6 regions exceed it in the average value; one region reaches it and 3 touch it.

In the last 14 days, we went from 305.47 new cases per 100,000 inhabitants between December 14 and 27 to 313.28 cases in the period from December 21 to January 3. Although the week under assessment was characterised by a lower number of tampons on public holidays, there is again an increase in incidence, which in the country now stands at 166.02 per 100. Although the week under assessment was characterized by a lower number of tampons on public holidays, there is again an increase in incidence, which in the country is now equal to 166.02 per 100,000 inhabitants in a week. As the monitoring booth report shows, the countrywide incidence is therefore still far from levels that would allow case identification and contact tracing to be fully restored throughout the country. As noted in the monitoring cabin report, the incidence across the territory is therefore still far from levels that would allow the full restoration of case identification and contact tracing across the national territory.

With a weekly incidence value of 166, we are 3 times higher than the ceiling of 50 new cases, considered the maximum threshold that can be managed by regional health services. No wonder, then, that the number of new cases not linked to known transmission chains is rising sharply from 31,825 to 40.825 to 40,487.487. The other automatic effect of the increase in the incidence rate is the progressive overload of hospital facilities.

              " \"Mr. President, Mr. Minister, honourable colleagues, the virus continues to spread rapidly; the emergence of new variants with greater dissemination capacity, even if with unchanged pathogenic action, has simply accelerated this process. We see this simply by observing what happens in other European countries, which in fact alternate measures and phases that are less restrictive with others that push up to total lockdown. Our country, which also experiences the difficulties of regionalization of the national health system as a result of the rules of Title V of the Constitution, in the path of the fight against coronavirus, despite the enormous difficulties involved, has always tried to maintain the right balance between restrictions and concessions, between openings and closings, despite the large problems and repercussions that each measure brought with it. We must never forget, however, a fundamental point that so many citizens demand: the protection of health comes first. The protection of the integrity and life of everyone goes beyond what may be the demands, even just and justified, of some. No one has ever forgotten, in the various measures adopted, the economic, social and complex problematic consequences for so many citizens that they would cause, but always trying to give concrete answers. The political will has always been to protect the most disadvantaged economic groups and the most fragile and vulnerable people in our social state. Unfortunately, a greater elasticity and a reduction in the most restrictive measures is almost a logical consequence of a rapid increase in infections, an acceleration in the spread of the virus and its surge with the rise of the RT index. Increasingly, it is necessary to insist on the continuous awareness and information of citizens, in recalling their sense of citizenship and belonging to the community. If we do not all succeed in this process of maturation and inner processing, we will not be able to eradicate or defeat the virus. Any measure, even the most shared and participated, requires the convinced adherence of every citizen. It's an adherence that for the most part has been and for which we can only thank the Italians. It's important to remember that the rules apply and are fully realized only if each of us understands that, in this pandemic, everyone has to do their part every day, not out of simple obligation or fear of sanctions, but because our responsible behaviour is an indispensable condition in the difficult battle against the coronavirus. Those who govern must know how to sparkle and balance the measures with the right balances. If the virus is so dynamic and changeable in its aggressiveness, even the consequential policy choices cannot be static, but must be balanced and modified in relation to the trend of the pandemic. I would like to highlight two aspects in particular in the architecture of the DPCM that we are analysing. The first relates to the introduction, in the context of the subdivision of the different zones according to the infectivity index recorded, of the so-called white area, which provides for less restrictive measures than the so-called yellow area, always in order to ensure the maximum consistency between the epidemiological scenario applicable to each territory and the degree of rigor of the containment measures applied. This innovation, agreed with the technical-scientific committee, represents and encompasses, at this particular moment, more than anything else, a symbolic value and a message of encouragement to Italians: be more virtuous and attentive you can and you must. The second aspect concerns the lowering of the threshold value of RT infection rates, to enter or pass through the various areas. Certainly, a fundamental support in the management of this pandemic has begun with the administration of vaccines, whose progressive availability will allow us to have a lethal weapon against the virus, starting with those in the front line, such as health workers, and the weakest and most fragile members of the population. The tens of thousands of deaths, the suffering of intensive care, the gaze lost in the void of those who know that they may not make it are a warning to institutions and citizens, to try to do more and better, in the interest of the community. The many required sacrifices, to which so many have adhered, with awareness and conscience, cannot be undone when, despite the many doubts and uncertainties, at the moment when the vaccination campaign has just begun, we finally step into the light, at the bottom of a tunnel.\\n\",\n",

It is difficult, in fact, for those who do not share them or feel excluded from them, who once again feel neglected, to apply them willingly and feel involved.

Then - as scientists have been telling us for months, since the rapid tampons were developed in June, which are commonplace and can basically be used with very common technical skills, rather than scientific ones - they spread and are found on every street corner, in our cities and in the various squares. There are many volunteers who would like to do this but find bureaucratic obstacles: in the granting of land, in the ASL and even in the identification of doctors who can do this type of activity. In fact, colleagues, not all doctors can do it, although the one to do with rapid tampons is an absolutely banal and simple activity. Lowering the price and making tampons accessible, so that they become a real social habit, through light custody, without large expenses, perhaps also managed by volunteers of the Red Cross or other associations, is important, so that jointly and not disjointly from vaccination allow us to slow down the speed of spread of the virus.

              " 'You, Mr Minister, are well aware that this virus has exacerbated and widened inequalities, hitting the most vulnerable and disadvantaged people the hardest. Hospitals have been overwhelmed by the epidemic wave, despite the extraordinary commitment of the staff, which I want to emphasize. Several screening and oncology visits have been skipped, and many non-Covid diseases cannot be treated; many people who are not self-sufficient have not been able to access therapies; in particular, those with mental disorders and mental frailty could not be followed. So if we have more doctors, more nurses and more ICU beds compared to a year ago and we have put an additional 12 billion in healthcare, we know that we will need more investment. Closing these gaps and getting the most vulnerable people back into the system must be our first priority. You, Mr Minister, have rightly reminded this House that Covid has only a few months and that with vaccines we will defeat the virus. We must not, therefore, misread this decisive phase. Now, in fact, the most complex moment arrives, that of the mass administration: it is a long and complex work, involving all the institutions and requiring maximum collaboration and a widespread information campaign. The country is ready to increase the number of doses to be administered as soon as the new vaccines are authorised. In this sense and in the light of my reference to the need to protect the most vulnerable, I ask you, Mr Minister, to formalize as soon as possible the commitment made by Commissioner Arcuri on priority vaccinations for people with disabilities and their carers. It would be really important to clarify this aspect once and for all. People with disabilities have suffered more than others from the effects of Covid and have often been left alone. Now it is necessary to protect them, as with all other fragile people. I will conclude by dedicating a few more minutes to an issue which is particularly close to my heart and which is one of the commitments we are asking the Government to make: I am talking about schools. It took the pandemic - I say this without any polemical spirit - to put the school at the centre of the public debate?This will perhaps be one of the few positive aspects that the health crisis will leave us. Our country, like many others, has had to deal with a terrible uncertainty, caused by a completely unprecedented situation. In recent days, nations such as Germany and Britain have deemed necessary the painful decision to close all schools of every order and grade. Every country has had to deal with the difficulty of keeping schools open in a situation where the third wave is no longer just a hypothesis. Schools are places where, despite the great prevention work done and the extraordinary commitment - which I want to emphasize - of school administrators, teaching and non-teaching staff and students, you can still get infected. We must continue to work in synergy with the Regions to enable, in the light of the evolution of the epidemiological picture you have indicated with precise data, the return of as many students as possible to the classroom. It is clear, in fact, that this generation is paying dearly for the lack of adequate classrooms and, even more so, the lack of relationships. Further solutions will be needed, in addition to improved transport and flexible schedules. There will have to be a refreshment for this generation that we can call cognitive and emotional. I am not talking about an economic restructuring, but one that is even more important. Investments, initiatives, school activities for recovery, support for what has been taken away from this generation in these long months, strengthening of services and territorial networks, renewal of teaching, as if distance learning could replace teaching in person, and therefore investments in teachers and their training and services aimed at psychophysical well-being. Now we have to work to preserve the ability of students to get out of this season with as little damage as possible, so I hope that we work to strengthen the tools we have, giving priority to pedagogical and psychological support to students, because, in addition to the serious problem of educational debt that is piling up, the problem of economic and social inequalities has intensified, but there is also - and perhaps most importantly - the emotional discomfort of students who are lost, seeking meaning for their present and future days, because, if we fail to build answers, we are risking the future of the country.\\n',\n",

Mr President, representatives of the Government, ladies and gentlemen, Italy is off to a good start on vaccines, but as Minister Speranza pointed out, this is a marathon which is won by perfecting not only the supply machine but also the administration. The feeling is that, since the start of the vaccine campaign, many doubters have changed their minds and that the skepticism that floated in some small segments of public opinion is disappearing. This is why we must continue with the approach you have indicated, that of listening and comparison, avoiding clashes between fans, which would have negative consequences from all angles. We are confidently waiting for 29 January, because if the European medicines agency (EMA) authorises the AstraZeneca vaccine, that day we will really see the light at the end of the tunnel and it seems, as the Minister said, that the request for authorisation by Johnson & Johnson for its vaccine, which has the great advantage of requiring a single dose to guarantee full protection, is also imminent. In the meantime, however, we must continue to manage the situation responsibly and with the prudential approach that has always guided the government's decisions. Of course, there have been times when citizens have found it difficult to understand some decisions, especially when the cards were changed at the last moment, when there was no linearity in communications or when some measures did not seem to meet a proportionality criterion. Despite this, we believe that overall the regional differentiation model has worked and that above all it is adequate to face the phase that awaits us, a phase, that is, when infections do not decrease, there is the unknown of the virus variants, there is the risk that the second wave will be grafted onto the third one immediately, as is happening in other countries. A new wave would jeopardize the vaccination campaign and we absolutely cannot afford this. So the new measures are fine, but only if the restrictions increase and the aid must be increased. Ten months have passed since the first closures, an unsustainable time for most businesses and businesses who are now fighting their battle for survival. So, immediately after the budget displacement, immediately after that white tax year for the self-employed, immediately after compensation to take into account the loss of turnover, immediately after the tax files for small and medium-sized enterprises, which in recent months have not been able to work or have been able to work only to a limited extent. At the same time, Mr Minister, the experience of recent months suggests that certain derogations from specific contexts or situations are necessary and do not in any way represent a danger. This is particularly true in mountainous areas, where the closure of ski lifts is also becoming a problem for the police and hence for the security of the area. Managers should be given the opportunity to open the ski lifts, which without tourism and without travel between the regions would only have the effect of distributing even better the people who climb mountains for motor activities and individual sports and who today, with the ski lifts closed, tend to concentrate in certain areas. It is a matter of making outdoor activities even safer, with people spread over a radius of hundreds of metres, much less dangerous than shopping in a shopping centre or a Saturday afternoon in the streets of the city's shopping centre. Instead, let us treasure what we have learned in these months and what we see every day in our territories, let us promote those individual and collective behaviours that do not pose a risk and that make people's lives less strenuous and above all let us accompany these new measures with an unprecedented commitment to the economy and to the vaccination campaign, which is the most important battle, the one that will lead us out of this tragic experience.\\n\",\n",

              " \"PARENTE (IV-PSI). Mr. President, ladies and gentlemen, the Viva Italia - Socialist Party Group will vote yes to the majority resolution. This is the time of responsibility in the face of the pandemic, but Minister, let this resolution really be a starting point to rebuild healthcare and not navigate by sight as too many times the virus has forced us to do. Health can and should be the highest form of democracy and equality, without any difference in age, gender, territory, health status and income. This is the ideal that is shaped by the National Health Service which you have said many times that you want to defend, and rightly so. But too much inequality and too much falsehood still circulates. Let's think about science. You said it right that science is our beacon. How many falsehoods are still going around about vaccines, that would not be safe because the very short time available to get a vaccine would have jumped the steps?This is not true because the phases have been carried out simultaneously by researchers from all over the world. In the Commission we are carrying out a very important investigation, consulting the leading Italian experts who reassure us on this point. Mr Minister, we must implement transparent institutional and policy information and ensure continuous updating to take our citizens by the hand. As far as traceability is concerned, I do not know how many times I have said that we have tabled amendments, because there is no national plan on tampons. As Mr De Falco said very well before, it is the cost and accessibility of tampons that are the biggest differences between territories and regions. You, Mr Minister, have called for unity, which must be practiced through dialogue, also in Parliament, and this is where we must start if we really want to defend health. As for schools, there is an important proposal. Tuscany has taken a number of measures, from transport, to tutors who go to bus stops and help children keep their distance (the project is called Ti accompagno). We ask Minister Azzolina to take this initiative as a national experiment. What do we need?We cannot, after a year, be at the same level as last March. We have to get out of this lockdown. Vaccines will protect us, but we have to defend vaccines. How do we defend them?With rules, which we always ask our citizens to respect, and, for example, with a protocol for workers. Mr. Minister, let us not always be overwhelmed by problems without anticipating and addressing them. In the newspapers we read about the issue of dismissals of workers who do not want to be vaccinated. Mr. Minister, call the social partners together and we renew the protocol of 24 April last on work environments, which has allowed infections not to be so widespread in the workplace, and we discuss the specifics of different jobs together with the social partners. Vaccinations for the elderly should be done in the places closest to them. Therefore, we do not think that the elderly can be called by the ASL to go to who knows where to get vaccinated. We immediately involve general practitioners. Speaking of proximity, you appropriately set up a Commission chaired by Monsignor Paglia on the question of the review of RSA. We must move quickly on this aspect too, moving beyond the RSA model and promoting home-based integrated medicine especially for the elderly. I always hope that the Parliament can also talk about ESM resources, because this is the issue that needs to be addressed. I repeat, we are making a big plan for home care for the elderly. Moreover, it is not possible that in a pandemic situation there are still precarious people in the Agenas, among doctors, healthcare staff and social workers. We see this pandemic as a tremendous opportunity to have zero precariousness in health and social services. I personally proposed the establishment of a national health guard as we need to prepare for any other pandemics. We therefore need flexibility (and not just building facilities and intensive therapies) and ongoing training of health personnel and also volunteers who are periodically trained to respond to emergencies. Health, in fact, must cease to be culturally relevant to the sick, but must be protected and defended by those who are healthy. We must therefore focus on primary and secondary prevention, home care, digitization and local medicine. In the Health Committee we recently unanimously approved a resolution that talks about resuming care for non-Covid patients (for example oncological and cardiopathic), because it is absurd that they are neglected. With these figures, Mr Minister, and with the data you have brought with you regarding the fact that hospitals are filling up, we cannot afford to abandon more patients; therefore we must absolutely act in this direction. Mr Minister, colleagues, we must recover the beauty of everyday life, because our lives are turned upside down. For those who believe, the Pope on Sunday made a beautiful speech on the meaning of the baptism of Jesus. Jesus came among us to be close to us and to take up our daily lives. She called for unity and I appeal to her: to take up the daily life, the beauty of the daily life of our fellow citizens, we must first set an example. Let us take up the daily relationship between the Government and Parliament, even with the opposition, in a fruitful and productive dialectic for the good of the country.\\n\",\n",

With regard to the two main lines of action which the Government should have taken as a matter of great priority - I refer, on the one hand, to measures to contain health and, on the other, to measures to restrict and deprive the freedom of enterprise and individuals - we have seen you engaged only on the second, that is, on restricting. Minister, before I tell you the vote, I tell you what has not been done in the field of health containment: no tests have been done. Last Monday, we made 90,000 tampons; in England, we made 500. I would like to ask the Commissioner whether he is prepared to accept the amendments tabled by the Committee on the Environment, Public Health and Consumer Protection. We've been saying for months that, since the tracking system has been broken, and this is unfortunately a fact - that tampons, even quick ones, are used to identify people who are carriers of the virus without symptoms. It's such a trivial thing to do, doing it in such large numbers, that you don't understand what you're doing with this virus mapping. You haven't made home care protocols for general practitioners.

              " \"ERRANI (Misto-LeU). - (IT) Mr President, we thank the Minister, especially after his speech in this House today, for the work he is doing. It's not an easy job. There are many masters of commentary, but I challenge anyone to prove that in such a dramatic story there are those who already have the answers. I should like to ask you to be cautious. Even a description of reality in which it is said that nothing has been done, zero, that there are no results, that everything has to be done over again, in Bartali, does not do honour, in my opinion, even to the opposition, because you know very well that this is not the case. I would like to try to point out three things that we should all be thinking about. It is clear that vaccines open up a new condition, a positive outlook. In this regard, the comments made in the early days of the start of the vaccination campaign proved to be imprecise, to put it mildly. All the comments said that we had already failed the vaccination campaign, but the results so far are positive. Vaccination is a difficult and very complicated process. It is one thing to vaccinate, for example, healthcare workers and those working in RSAs, but it is another thing to vaccinate the masses to achieve herd immunity. And then - as has been rightly said - certain public functions require consistency: if an operator of a RSA decides not to vaccinate, it is legitimate, but he must choose not to operate in those structures anymore. I say this not to make an ideological controversy, but for a problem that - as we have seen - is very concrete. Mr. Minister, I think it is right to support all efforts at transparency on the issue of vaccines to allow even those who are not in the majority who support this Government to have all the elements and data at their disposal to use and interpret them. Let's make an extra effort, because at least on the issue of vaccines we could not say find a formal unity, but support a common commitment to achieve a result for all. The second point concerns the pandemic. I want to make a little personal observation that doesn't involve anyone. The data is growing, and there's no question about that. There is no point in continuing, depending on the position, to call for the opening or closing of businesses. Clearly, if countries such as Britain, Germany and the Netherlands - practically the whole of Europe - are further tightening the rules, there must be a reason. Can we say that it is the government's responsibility if the pandemic data is growing?No: if we look anywhere in Europe and the world, the data tells us that this is not the case. I say very clearly that, for the Christmas holidays, I was for a stricter solution; I understand all the problems, but I was for a stricter solution, because this is the only way today to reduce the growth of the pandemic. And I'm not the only one saying this, but - as you know - Fontana and Zaia have said it, because it's an objective fact, and we should therefore avoid fighting about it. We need a shift of 24 billion and we could work on another very important aspect - of course, if we start working on the merits and not on accusations, counter-accusations and controversies - and that is on building a restaurant system based on turnover and the tax mechanism. I make this argument, primarily aimed at the opposition, because I believe that the most critical elements are health and economic confusion and uncertainty. This is the effort that is required of us: an effort that is not of political positioning, but of opening a new phase in the country. You, the Minister, have always been consistent and have always come to this House, but what I fear most are the ritualistic assembly meetings in which they always say the same things and we fail to make a step forward. It is all very well to think about this, but let us take a few steps forward. From this discussion comes the message about the need for vaccinations and I appreciate what the opposition has said in this regard: no one is against vaccination. From this point of view, Minister, I personally think talking about white areas is a message. I 'm sorry .\\n\",\n",

First of all, Mr Zaffini said that in Europe we did everything wrong. I say that it is not at all so, as the scientists we have heard from in the Commission have also acknowledged. To the specific question about what we did wrong, they said: what could people do who didn't know which way to go. So it was done very well; obviously corrections needed to be made, but we didn't know what to expect. So it was done very well; obviously we need to make corrections, but we didn't know what to expect. So I have to say that, both in terms of the vaccination campaign that we are facing, and also in terms of what has been done before in the emergency, we have all tried. Other European countries are no better off than we are. As we know, we are now among the first regions in Europe to vaccinate, so we can also address this emergency. As we know, we are now among the first regions in Europe to vaccinate, so we can also address this emergency.

In all this, the fastest possible administration of the vaccine can allow us to return to normalcy in a short time, so it is right to immunize all health workers - as has been said, they are those who face the virus in the front row - as well as the weaker categories, arriving - as the National Vaccine Plan says very well - to vaccinate other categories, planning to anticipate the vaccination for teachers to promote the reopening of schools, which Senator I spoke very well about earlier, as many other colleagues have done.

While it is true that we need to get people out of hospitals and lighten our healthcare facilities, we believe that school is another fundamental and important factor. It is really about the health of our young people, including the mental discomfort they are experiencing right now. It is therefore a question of finding an adaptive strategy for pandemic planning and vaccination. Professor Brusaferro said that it will be necessary to assess situations and vaccinate in case of outbreaks. I am also thinking of other sectors, starting with transport, which must not only be reorganised; we must also think of transport operators, as well as the prison staff themselves, who are helping us at this time. I am also thinking of other sectors, starting with transport, which must not only be reorganised; we must also think of transport operators, as well as the prison staff themselves, who are helping us at this time. It is therefore - I repeat - a question of adapting in a flexible way what is a plan that we all know and which is very important to follow. Mr Minister, I would add that citizens are now very, very tested, and I am also thinking of their mental health, which I have just mentioned when I speak of young people. It is also important to address this aspect, which is not insignificant, because the psychological health of individuals is the psychological health of society as a whole, which is essential for maintaining it. As I feel and as I think we all see, people are starting to feel some resentment about what is happening. It is therefore essential that attention is also paid to psychological health, an important aspect which I therefore ask you to take into account.

I very much appreciated the way you used your serious tone and institutional seriousness today, Minister. If the whole Government had done so in these difficult months for everyone, we would have avoided some more trouble. You have today appealed to Parliament for accountability and unity. Let me welcome your appeal and let me also appeal from the opposition to the Government for accountability and unity. This is indeed the moment when the country cannot see any republican institution acting lightly and superficially. I say this because we are all aware that today a new and very delicate phase of the country is opening, in which the whistles and indecent shows are banned, which we have seen here, but also the easy triumphalisms that we have used in some phases of the management of the pandemic are banned. As Mr Errani said, we cannot deny that the data of the first phase, which are encouraging data on vaccinations, concern health workers at a time when vaccination of the population has not even begun. This is fundamental, without accusation or criticism. I am addressing Mr Errani specifically: we are ready to work in a loyal collaboration. He referred to the vaccine plan, the refreshments and the rules. Minister, the first ground on which to create collaboration is respect for Parliament: no more measures without the possibility of discussion, abuse of DPCM, budget laws not even open. Together with Mrs Bonino, Operation Plus Europe, we have tabled a resolution, and I thank her for the attention she has paid to it, which has three very simple points: sharing the vaccine plan with the Chambers, transparency and institutional communication, surveillance of immunological properties.\\n',\n",

Mr President, on 4 January the Government declassified the National Charter of Potentially Suitable Areas for the Storage of Nuclear Waste, which identifies some 60 potential sites throughout Italy, including 14 selected areas in Sardinia. The urgent need to make this map public stops, in order to start the complex procedure of identifying the most suitable site to receive this radioactive waste - the procedure will require, however, a time not less than forty-four months - let us think of the European infringement procedure, the costs we pay in the bill to store this waste, but above all the safety problems for the communities that live in the current sites now precarious. Despite this, however, we cannot fail to remind our rulers of the political and social position of the Sardinians on the issue.

              " 'With this provision, Canada, which has traditionally been a stranger to this type of system because it is geared to the trademark system, has recognized a number of European geographical indications, including 41 Italian ones which, moreover, represent about 90 per cent of the value of our PDO and PGI exports to Canada and are in addition to those of wines already recognized and protected.\\n',\n",

As for the geographical indications for which coexistence with trademarks already registered in Canada was envisaged (in particular, Parmigiano Reggiano, three Italian hams and three our cheeses), this solution, chosen to protect the rights acquired by local operators, has nevertheless allowed the protection of some European products previously considered generic names, as well as allowing the marketing of some products, in particular Parma ham. As regards the geographical indications for which coexistence with trademarks already registered in Canada was envisaged (in particular, Parmigiano Reggiano, three Italian hams and three our cheeses), this solution, chosen to protect the rights acquired by local operators, nevertheless allowed the protection of certain European products previously considered generic names, as well as allowing the marketing of certain products, in particular Parma ham. The latter, in fact, before CETA could not be entered on the Canadian market with its name, but only as original ham, given the existence of a trademark Parma registered forty years earlier. The latter, before CETA, could not be placed on the Canadian market with its name, but only as  original ham, given the existence of a trademark  Parma registered forty years earlier. In addition, the Agreement contains specific provisions against Italian sounding, such as the prohibition of evocation for non-originating products (i.e. the prohibition of the use of symbols, photos, colours and the like which may evoke the origin of the geographical indication), the obligation to indicate the origin on the label in a clear and visible manner, the obligation to further differentiate for products introduced on the market after a certain date, which must bear the indication of  use/imitation  style and so on, as well as the possibility of administrative recourse by the proprietors of individual intellectual property rights of geographical indications. Furthermore, the Agreement contains specific provisions against Italian sounding, such as the prohibition of evocation for non-originating products (i.e. the prohibition on the use of symbols, photographs, colours and the like which may evoke the origin of the geographical indication), the obligation to indicate the origin on the label in a clear and visible manner, the obligation for further differentiation for products placed on the market after a certain date, which must bear the words  style/imitation  and so on, and the possibility of administrative recourse by holders of intellectual property rights in individual geographical indications. In the light of the foregoing, therefore, and with reference to the further point made by the applicant concerning the timing of imports into the European Union of products bearing the designation Parmesan originating in Canada, it is clear that European legislation expressly prohibits their marketing, since the term Parmesan is not generic but is an evocation of the designation Parmigiano Reggiano and as such cannot be used in the European Union for cheeses which do not comply with the specifications of the Italian PDO. Import cases which infringe the exclusive right in the Union of the PDO Parmigiano Reggiano and its synonyms may be reported to the competent authorities of the Member States - in the case of Italy, it is the Central Authority for the Protection of Food Quality and the Suppression of Agricultural Fraud (RFICQ) and the Ministry of Agricultural Policy, in accordance with the Uniform Rules. Any cases of import infringing the exclusive right in the Union of the PDO Parmigiano Reggiano and its synonyms may be reported to the competent authorities of the Member States - in the case of Italy, it is the Central Inspectorate for the Protection of Quality and Combating Fraud in Agri-Food Products (ICQRF) of the Ministry of Agricultural, Food and Forestry Policies, pursuant to Union Regulation No 1151/2012 - which are obliged to take appropriate administrative and judicial measures to prevent or terminate the unlawful use of the Geographical Indications produced, protected or marketed in the Member State.1151/2012 - which are required to take appropriate administrative and judicial measures to prevent or put an end to the unlawful use of protected geographical indications produced or marketed in the Member State.

In relation to the issue of product protection on the Italian market and compliance with consumer labelling requirements, I would point out that the provision of clear, understandable and legible information on food for consumer protection - a matter harmonised at European level, where EU Regulation 1169/2011 ensures a high level of consumer protection, regulating all aspects of labelling - is a matter of utmost importance and commitment for this Ministry. Finally, in relation to the issue of product protection on the Italian market and compliance with consumer protection labelling requirements, I would point out that the provision of clear, understandable and legible information on consumer food - a matter harmonised at European level, where EU Regulation 1169/2011 ensures a high level of consumer protection, regulating all aspects of labelling - is of the utmost importance and commitment for this Ministry. This is evidenced, for example, by the letter signed jointly last March by Minister Bellanova and Minister of Economic Development Stefano Patuanelli, sent to the European Commissioners for Health and Agriculture, in which Italy requested that the obligation of origin on the label be extended to all foodstuffs, starting with a quick choice on these products, which have already been tested for years on raw materials such as processed milk, pasta, tomatoes, rice, caramelized rice. This is evidenced, for example, by the letter signed jointly by Minister Bellanova and Minister of Economic Development Stefano Patuanelli last March, sent to the European Commissioners for Health and Agriculture, in which Italy requested that the obligation of origin of the raw materials on the label be extended to all foods, starting with a quick choice on products on which it has already experimented in recent years such as milk, cheeses, processed meats, pasta, rice, tomato derivatives. With this in mind, the Ministers have notified Brussels of the extension until 31 December 2021 of the Decree of 9 December 2016 on milk and cheeses and have then signed the Ministerial Decree of 1 April 2020, which also extends the mandatory provisions of indication of origin, on the label, of durum wheat for durum wheat germ paste, rice and tomato derivatives until 31 December 2021. This is in the belief that in the Farm fork to strategy the mandatory origin must be a central theme, precisely because since that phrase translates from the mandatory field to ta, the origin best explains this interpretation, so that in the label the consumer has the perception of the origin or path of traceability. This is in the belief that in the Farm to Fork strategy the compulsory origin must be a central theme, precisely because since that phrase translates from the field to the table, the compulsory origin best declines this need, so that in the label the consumer has the perception of the entire traceability path. As for the control activities, with specific reference to the one set up by the Central Inspectorate for the Protection of Quality and Fraud Prevention of Agri-Food Products (ICQRF), the latter pays the utmost attention to the verification of the indication of origin reported on agri-food products. This is also done through sample checks of traceability, to ascertain its veracity, to counter the phenomenon of Italian sounding, to protect made in Italy and the most representative productions in this area, with particular reference to those protected by specific legislation of the European Union (PDO and PGI products). Through the assistance and cooperation systems between competent authorities of the Member States of the European Union Administrative assistance and cooperation system (AAC) and Food fraud network (FF), of which the ICQRF is the contact point for Italy together with the Ministry of Health, the reports exchanged with the authorities of other Member States concerning irregularities found on labelling devices are processed. The Administrative assistance and cooperation system (AAC) and the Food Fraud Network (FF), of which the ICQRF is the contact point for Italy together with the Ministry of Health, handle the reports exchanged with the authorities of other Member States concerning irregularities detected on labelling devices. Specific memoranda of understanding have also been signed with the main online trading platforms (eBay, Amazon, Alibaba) on web-based trade, strengthening the protection of consumers using these e-commerce platforms, as well as the promotion, promotion and information on Italian PDO and PGI products, so that the phenomena of misappropriation of Italian quality designations registered on the online market are counteracted. Specific Memoranda of Understanding have also been signed with the main online trading platforms (eBay, Amazon, Alibaba) on web commerce, strengthening the protection of consumers using these e-commerce platforms, as well as the promotion, promotion and information on Italian PDO and PGI products, in order to counter the phenomena of usurpation of Italian registered quality names on the online market. In response to the questions raised by the questioner as to whether Italy's ratification of CETA - instead of representing an opportunity for our country - would, on the contrary, become a vehicle for facilitating the importation of agri-food products with lower safety standards than those in Europe, I reply by pointing out that all agri-food products coming from Canada will have to comply with European sanitary and phytosanitary legislation, including the rules governing access to genetically modified organisms and products. Similarly, due to the precautionary principle - which is enshrined in Article 191 of the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union (TFEU) and is binding and cannot be amended or repealed by any international agreement, including CETA - and sanitary and phytosanitary legislation, products treated with substances that are banned as harmful (at present, the use of glyphosate is still authorised in the European Union) or for which there is no scientific evidence of harm but a suspected risk to human health, will not be able to enter the internal market of the European Union. Therefore, while the precautionary principle remains valid, the European Union will continue to apply its legislation on the prohibition of hormones in livestock, as provided for in Directive 96/22/EC, as amended by Directive 2003/74/EC. In addition, the import of untreated meat from third countries using hormones in livestock for their internal market is only possible if the segregation of farms is ensured, which also applies to the use of antibiotics banned in the European Union, as provided for in Directive 96/23/EC. In addition, the import of untreated meat from third countries that use livestock hormones for their internal market is only possible if livestock segregation is ensured, a principle which also applies to the use of antibiotics banned in the European Union, as provided for in Directive 96/23/EC. This principle was clearly reaffirmed in the declarations annexed to the European Council procedure for the adoption of the decision authorising the signature of CETA on behalf of the Union. This principle has been clearly reaffirmed in the declarations annexed to the procedure of the European Council for the adoption of the decision authorising the signature of CETA on behalf of the Union. Finally, while specifically addressing the issue of GMOs, it should be recalled that, with the implementation of Directive 2015/412/EU, the definitive ban on the cultivation of all varieties of MON810 maize in Italy (Commission Decision No. Finally, while specifically addressing the issue of GMOs, it should be recalled that the implementation of Directive 2015/412/EU has resulted in a definitive ban on the cultivation of all MON810 maize varieties in Italy (Commission Decision No 321 of 3 March 2016) and on all GM maize still being authorised for placing on the market.321 of 3 March 2016) and of all transgenic maize still being authorised for placing on the market. The cultivation of such transgenic maize, whether authorised or authorised, shall be punishable by the penalties provided for in Article 35a of Legislative Decree No. The cultivation of such GM maize, authorised or in the process of being authorised, shall be punishable by the penalties provided for in Article 35a of Legislative Decree No 224 of 8 July 2003.224. To date, no new marketing authorisation applications have been submitted for the cultivation of new GMOs, either for maize or other species. To date, no new applications for marketing authorisation have been submitted for the cultivation of new GMOs, whether for maize or other species. The current legislative system therefore allows action on all new GMOs for which a European cultivation authorisation is applied for, while at the same time the sanctioning system is able to punish all possible cases of infringement of the rules in force. Therefore, the current legislative system enables action to be taken on all new GMOs for which a European cultivation authorisation is requested, while at the same time the sanctioning system is able to punish all possible cases of infringement of the rules in force. As regards the legislation on labelling systems for food and feed containing genetically modified organisms, it is recalled that products, whether food or feed, consisting of, containing or derived from GMOs, are subject to the labelling and traceability requirements laid down in Community Regulations (EC) No 1829/2003 and (EC) No 1829/2003. This Regulation shall enter into force on the twentieth day following that of its publication in the Official Journal of the European Union.1830/2003. This ensures that information is provided to consumers and users of these products, enabling them to make an informed choice. This ensures that information is provided to consumers and users of such products, enabling them to make an informed choice. Regulation (EC) No 1829/2003 provides that foods derived from GMOs intended for the final consumer or food suppliers to the public are to be labelled with the statement on the presence of GMOs. Regulation (EC) No 1829/2003 provides that food derived from GMOs intended for the final consumer or food suppliers must bear on the label the statement on the presence of GMOs. In addition, Regulation No 1830 of 2003 also requires genetically modified food to comply with the requirements on traceability, defined as the ability to trace GMOs and products derived from GMOs at all stages from placing on the market through the production and distribution chain. To ensure traceability, operators handling products containing, consisting of or produced from GMOs are required to provide specific information to the subsequent operator in the chain at all stages of production and distribution. In order to ensure traceability, operators dealing with products containing, consisting of or produced from GMOs are required to provide specific information to the subsequent operator in the chain at all stages of production and distribution.

We expect from those who govern, independently of the Government and hoping that soon there will be a centre-right Government in Italy, the utmost commitment to defend the name and quality of our products, which are the best in the world. We demand that the government of any country should confront those who try to imitate our valuable products with similar products - you mentioned Parmesan several times - which have nothing to do with ours, but which in some way deceive consumers and threaten the economic and productive system of the country. We have been fighting for many years for the products that end up on our tables to be labelled and also traceable, as you said, so that they can be traced back to their origins and ingredients before they can become food. We, as a parliamentary group and as a party with our leader, Giorgia Meloni, will always keep our eyes peeled before any agreement - in this case CETA, an international agreement with Canada - because first and foremost we want Italy, our economy and our production system.

With all due respect and thanks to Undersecretary L'Abbate for his presence in this House and for the kindness with which he answered, even if unsatisfactory, the questions put, I would like to point out that I personally would have expected the presence of Minister Franceschini, that is, the Minister who has a delegation for tourism, or the Minister who has somehow a delegation for youth. For goodness sake, agriculture is always good, but it is certainly not the heart of the problem. What we are experiencing is one of the most dramatic economic and health emergencies that the country has ever experienced - it is said - since the end of World War II and we are facing a situation where we have all tourism stuck, with a dry loss that will mean that it will be years before the sector can be restarted. What we are experiencing is one of the most dramatic economic and health emergencies that the country has ever experienced - it is said - since the end of the Second World War and we are facing a situation in which we have all tourism blocked, with a dry loss that will make it take years before the sector can be put back into motion. However, within the framework of this tourism that we could define as non-profit, a service tourism, we have youth tourism, that is, the availability that allows a young person to broaden cultural horizons and also the social perspective, through this movement activity that allows Italian young people to have the experience of going abroad and those who come from abroad to come to Italy. It is obvious that in the lockdown, just as we are all locked in - and the next decree of the President of the Council of Ministers represents a further limitation on what we might call individual freedoms - we are depriving our young people of school attendance, of cultural experiences, even of deepening, those related to university life and internships, and in this case also of that capacity to broaden horizons. Let us not forget, however, that in the sixties the youth hostels themselves - and this is not an indifferent element - changed from the original designation of moral institutions to that of welfare institutions, because it seemed almost as if it were necessary to assist in some way from the economic and organizational point of view young people in their movements, then to the current one of cultural institutions. We are, therefore, once again considering the world of young people in the worst possible way, that is, not considering it. Clearly the answer and even the speech of my predecessor seems almost to look with greater interest at the guarantee of jobs, but we know that this guarantee is hanging by a thread, which we could call at the moment the famous thread of the integrated fund and which will be subject to the cut of 30 March, when the ban on redundancies will be lifted. It is clear that the answer and also the speech of the colleague who preceded me seem almost to look with greater interest at the guarantee of jobs, but we know that this guarantee is hanging by a thread, which we could call at the moment the famous thread of the integrated fund and which will in any case be subject to the cut of 30 March, when the ban on dismissals will be lifted. We are facing a political attitude capable of turning over to this sector the blindness of a country that does not consider tourism its real black gold. The example of tourism as the black gold of the country is an example that was made by Minister Franceschini, Minister for two legislatures. Now we do not know what will happen in the next Government: maybe Minister Franceschini will become the Head of Government and maybe, if so, he will give tourism and culture a much greater importance than it has been until now, but we know that this kind of black gold, which is Italian tourism, has never been able to be taken into account as the country's own wealth, an economic wealth, an enogastronomic wealth - and this certainly also concerns his skills - a cultural wealth that is tradition, but also the ability to look ahead. Now we do not know what will happen in the next Government: perhaps Minister Franceschini will become the Head of Government and maybe, if so, he will give tourism and culture a much greater importance than he has until now, but we know that this kind of black gold, which is Italian tourism, has never been able to be properly considered as the country's own wealth, an economic wealth, a wine and gastronomic wealth - and this certainly also concerns his skills - a cultural wealth that is made of tradition, but also of the ability to look forward. I think it is ridiculous today to ask this question about youth hotels: when the colleague put his question, as you know, there was still no pandemic, when I put mine we were in the phase of broadening the horizons, in the perspective of returning to a potential normality, while today we are sinking into a dramatic black hole from which we do not even know when and how we will be able to get out, given the impossibility of moving from one municipality to another or from one region to another. This means serious myopia of government, from a cultural, economic, social and organizational point of view, and it means blindness to the rights of the new generations. Other than the recovery plan as a right of the next generation! This is really blindness. This is really blindness. I can only take this moment to say that we hope that some good can come from evil.

On the same day, the excellent journalist Claudia Procentese published a post on her Facebook page, through which, with absolutely talking images, the national community came to know about this demolition, carried out in a few hours on the same day, then again on July 9 last year, so much so that then, as the Undersecretary said, the superlocation of the Superintendence for the metropolitan area of Naples is July 13.19 of 2009, the so-called house plan, which in Campania allows reconstructions even with increased cubature, where there is no prohibition with respect to any prescriptions of the Superintendence. Forgive me the expression, but the Ministry can not \"get away\" by claiming that the building was not protected. However, before deciding its fate, the Superintendence or the Municipality (a territorial body) would have had to initiate the procedure of verification of the cultural interest. This was neither done nor requested. The Superintendence claims to have been aware of what was happening at the time of the demolition, however, it admits that eighteen months earlier, i.e. in January 2019, based on a request from the previous October, it had answered a question about the binding situation by the notary in charge of the firm that carried out the demolition. This should have been an alarm bell, such as to simply induce the Superintendence, or someone inside it - we are talking about this, not street people - to make a phone call to the Municipality of Giugliano to know if it had given or was going to give the permission to demolish a historic building, on which there was no explicit constraint, but which certainly, being eighteenth century, had exceeded seventy years, so it was protected ex lege. There was then an involuntary complicity in turning the gaze the other way and we lost an important piece of the history of the territory. The associations Italia Nostra and Architetti in rete (AIR) have made a proposal for the acquisition of an item within the current General Regulatory Plan (GRP) for the protection of historic rural buildings. This is a countrywide problem. A national strategy for the protection of historic rural building heritage is needed.

Mr President, a week ago, on 7 January, in Il Giorno, in the pages of Milan, an article appeared that, for the first time, gave an account of the state of the art of negotiation between the State and Umberto Eco's heirs. Umberto Eco was a great narrator, philosopher, semiologist, journalist, who passed away exactly five years ago, in February 2016. He was born in January 1932 and now, after five years, those conversations - started about three years ago - between the family and the State - I refer to that article, followed, in the following days, by other interventions in the press - seem to arrive in port. He was born in January 1932 and now, five years later, those conversations - started about three years ago - between the family and the State - I refer to that article, followed, in the following days, by other interventions in the press - seem to be coming to fruition. Yet, unlike what was known until some time ago, namely that the Ministry for Cultural Heritage and Activities was dealing with the family, after having declared the particularly important historical interest of the compendium consisting of the library and archive of Umberto Eco, today we learn that the library, in relation to the part of the ancient and rare texts, will actually be purchased by the State and will be kept in the Braidense National Library of Milan and managed, precisely, by the Ministry. However, contrary to what was known until some time ago, namely that the Ministry for Cultural Heritage and Activities was dealing with the family, after having declared the particularly important historical interest of the compendium consisting of the library and archive of Umberto Eco, today it is learned that the library, in relation to the part of the ancient and rare texts, will actually be purchased by the State and will be kept in the national library Braidense in Milan and managed, precisely, by the Ministry. On the contrary, over 35,000 volumes - they are the most recent part of the library itself - and the papers, therefore the professor's archive, will be donated by the family to the State, but they will go to Bologna, and therefore not to Milan. In Bologna the University Alma Mater Studiorum, on the basis of an agreement with the family, which seems to have yet to be reached, will make available the spaces - they seem to have already been identified - to collect this part of the documentation and the books.

As I said, the library partly remains in Milan, partly goes to Bologna, the archive seems to go to Bologna.

According to the statutes of Consap, the directors are appointed for a period not exceeding three years, and they expire on the date of the meeting. Thus, Masi, unable to take up the role of CEO for the fourth time, obtained the presidency, while the chair of CEO went to Vincenzo Federico Sanasi D'Arpe. The statutes of CONSAP also state that only the managing director and the president may be awarded remuneration of between 160,000 and 180,000 in the case of delegation of operational tasks. This is the first time that the Commission has taken a decision on this matter. Consap manages, on behalf of the Mise, the Ministry of the Interior and the MEF, the role of public insurer for compensation and therefore manages certain compensation funds such as the guarantee and securitisation fund for losses provided for by the decree-law.

Consap also manages the savers' compensation fund (FIR) provided for in Law No 145 of 30 December 2018, i.e. compensation for savers who have suffered unfair prejudice, i.e. failed banks. Massi is also president of Banca Igea, another bank whose joint stock company saved Banca del Fucino, with 47,5 million losses; operation carried out through the transfer of 314 million non-performing loans (NPL) to the company for the management of activities that was SGA ex Banco di Napoli and became AMCO, a company participating in the MEF. Masi is also chairman of Banca Igea, another bank whose holding company rescued Banca del Fucino, with losses of 47.5 million, through the sale of 314 million non-performing loans (NPL) to the asset management company that was SGA formerly Banco di Napoli and became AMCO, a company owned by the MEF. As Rai's managing director, Masi was convicted of money laundering in relation to the public TV station and had to compensate the company for €100,000. As Director-General, he encouraged the exodus of the former director of the newspaper, Angela Buttiglione, and of the former director of Rai, Marcello del Bosco. As general director, he encouraged the exodus of the former director of the newspaper Angela Buttiglione and the former director of Rai Marcello del Bosco, making Rai pay out 680,000 euros; a figure that the Court of Auditors judged to be pecuniary damage with a judgment confirmed by the Court of Cassation on 16 October 2018.

              " 'At the beginning of this experience of government - on 9 September 2019 - I foreshadowed, precisely in this Chamber, a clear political project for the country. I immediately made it clear that the programme on which I was going to ask Parliament for confidence did not and could not be resolved in a mere list of heterogeneous proposals, nor, even less, in a sterile summary of the positions taken by each of the political forces that would have supported the majority. Already then I was aware that an alliance between political formations from different histories, traditions, experiences and cultures, which - in addition - had also been completely opposed, sometimes even in a very harsh way, in the most recent international scenario, could only arise on the basis of two fundamental differences: the European leadership, not only extrinsically interdependent, but also a convinced anchorage between the values of the Italian people - a way of recovering the role of the protagonist, even in the geopolitical and geopolitical context, in the European Union - and of making it possible to return to the role of the protagonist, in the first place, as the main protagonist, and in the second place, as a means of protecting the European identity, in the context of the European Union. From the moment the programme was drawn up, in which I myself participated, together with the delegations of the majority political forces, we all worked together to ensure that the perspective of a broad and courageous reform project was drawn up. I said then that this political project would mark the beginning of a new - which we all hoped for and still hope for - reform season, aimed at building a fairer and more inclusive society, able to combine the primary objective of economic growth, revitalisation and modernisation with the essential requirements of sustainability, social and territorial cohesion, in the context of the full development of the person. At the beginning of 2020, the conditions for the implementation of that project were measured, unfortunately, with the hurricane of the pandemic; it was and is a hurricane that has upset and is profoundly upsetting our society, our lifestyle habits, our collective destiny. The pandemic has forced us to redefine our priorities, to rethink our development model, the very dynamics of our relations. We are facing a challenge of epochal scope, we are measuring ourselves with the need to define the reconstructive lines of a society that is marked anew (seems to be a re-raining in the past) by primordial fears, often known precisely for generations of the past, as well as the risk of losing essential bonds between health, life and well-being, all of which are deeply fragile. Some of our deep-rooted convictions have suddenly been called into question. Politics itself has been forced to confront, almost daily, perhaps as never before, science and technology in the difficulty of providing effective and rapid responses to an overwhelming health emergency and a severe economic recession. Even our most established legal knowledge has been severely challenged. The state of emergency has forced us to introduce, first in the West, with all the doubts, perplexities and difficulties, and of course soon afterwards in all the other countries, restrictive measures of human rights, making very delicate and laborious balances between constitutional principles and rights. In these dramatic months, even in the face of unprecedented complexity, this majority has managed to demonstrate great responsibility, achieving, with some difficulty, convergences of views and resolutions of action, as was required especially in the most critical stages. We have cultivated a constant and close dialogue with all the institutional levels of our system, from the regional authorities to those of the municipalities, in the awareness that only by practicing regularly, in an unconventional way, the principle of cooperation, it would be possible to pursue the strategies that are considered to be effective in this area, especially in the areas of health. Not only that; the experience of the pandemic has strengthened in the political forces, which have loyally supported the Government, the awareness of the value of dialogue and dialectical confrontation between even distant positions, which is an inescapable premise to make the most correct choices, to make those superior syntheses in the highest collective interest, to take the fundamental decisions from which, due to the gravity of the hour, we could not escape. Everyone on the spot will express their opinions; we are in the field of the opinable. For my part, I can say that the Government has operated the delicate balances and constitutional interests involved from time to time with the utmost scruple and with the utmost care, in the awareness of the immense consequences that would have occurred in the lives of individuals and for the future of our community. If today, to you who are in this Chamber and to the citizens who follow us from home, I can speak with a high head, it is not because of the arrogance of those who believe that they have never made a mistake, but because of the awareness that, together with the entire government team, they have committed all their physical and intellectual energies, to offer the best possible protection to the national community.\\n',\n",

I would also like to mention two measures to give meaning to interventions that express a vision for the country, aimed at improving the competitiveness of our productive fabric, made up mainly of small and medium-sized enterprises; but of course also large enterprises are struggling in this context of crisis. I am referring to the SME Equity Fund, managed by Invitalia, which promotes the capitalization of small and medium-sized enterprises that invest in their relaunch, and the Destined Equity Fund, managed by Cassa depositi e prestiti, which can contribute not only to the support but also to the growth of enterprises with a turnover of more than EUR 50 million. Then, also in view of the great challenge of the recovery plan, we wanted to redefine with clarity the regulatory framework to support investments, in particular those in infrastructure. In fact, we have defined an accelerated path for the implementation of public works; we have intervened to redefine very carefully the system of liability of the public administration, in particular with regard to the redefinition of pecuniary liability, to the delimitation of the offence of abuse of office. In this respect, I often hear the objection raised (and I have to say that it happened yesterday in the House) that, after a few months, the works, even if they were considered priority in the framework of the simplification decree, would still be blocked, because the designation of the relevant Commissioners would be missing. These works have never been blocked, because Article 2 of the simplification decree has been applied, which gives special powers specific to the commissioners to the RUP (the sole project managers). We have reached a total of 43.3 billion compared to 39.4 billion in 2019.

Yesterday I announced to the House, in the field of electoral law, the commitment of the Government, of course respecting the autonomous determinations of the parliamentary forces, to promote and contribute to achieving an electoral reform, as far as competence is concerned, of a proportional system, as much as possible shared (because it is a system law), which can effectively combine the reasons for pluralism and representation with the need, although inescapable, to ensure an overall stability of the political system. I would like to clarify this point, because I am reading malicious interpretations, so to speak. In recent years we have seen a fragmentation of representation. The framework of political forces has become differentiated and new processes have emerged, which have established themselves in a completely new and even disruptive way. If we want to reconstruct this picture, it is not possible to do so with an electoral law that forces so different sensibilities into the same envelope. If we want to reconstruct this picture, it is not possible to do so with an electoral law that forces so different sensibilities into the same envelope. This would lead to political instability and uncertainty and would not stabilise the situation. Rather, it seems to me urgent to offer and contribute to the pursuit, as far as reason is concerned, of an instrument which can also make full use of its capacity to promote the democratic representation of all the differences on the ground, so that the various political forces can express their full potential, recover even from abstentionism distrusted citizens and define their profile sure and credible.

Obviously, these political forces, to govern, will be called upon to define programmatic agreements of high content and strong profile ideal, so as to generate governments based on clear programmes and able to offer a solid and fruitful perspective to all citizens. Of course, these political forces, in order to govern, will be called upon to define high-profile programmatic agreements with a strong ideal content, in order to generate governments based on clear programmes and capable of offering a solid and fruitful perspective to all citizens. The amendment of the electoral system can also be effectively accompanied by certain innovations in the institutional system, all the more necessary in view of the reduction in the number of parliamentarians, in line with the directions already shared by the majority parliamentary groups in the agreement reached in October 2019. It is then necessary to introduce some corrections to the form of government, inspired by the model of a rationalized parliamentarism that guarantees a more secure stability to the Executive and, at the same time, returns to Parliament a central role in defining the national political direction. As regards in particular the legislative procedure, some provisions aimed at rationalizing the approval of laws may be introduced, also in order to reduce the use of emergency decree, which in fact in the last year, due to the pandemic, has even more significantly increased or conditioned parliamentary activity.

To do all this, we need a Government and parliamentary forces willing and aware of the difficulties we are facing and the sensitivity of the tasks; we need people willing to recognise the importance of politics. In the opening part of my speech I claimed the political character of the choices made and the decisions taken. Politics is the noblest of the arts and of the sciences, because, if it is pursued in the right spirit and is always and in any case aimed at the well-being of citizens and the improvement of the quality of life, it becomes a very effective tool also for resolving the conflicts in society, for recognizing and coexisting differences and for interpreting situations, even the most diverse and distant. When politics is eclipsed, these demands end up on the margins, with the risk that they will remain unheard and therefore unheard or, worse, that they will turn into anger and lead to violent clashes. We have an urgency to do politics, all the more so in this context of widespread deprivation and deep suffering, because only politics offers us the possibility of interpreting the malaise of society, preventing it from exploding into destructive oppositions. Politics can help to make this malaise a productive and positive factor, a factor for the progress of the Nation. It is up to us, therefore, to promote and contribute to putting into political form the contradictions, aspirations, needs and the will on the part of all to express their potential. I think first of all of the workers and all the productive forces, which are the decisive components to be encouraged and promoted for the future of the Republic. This Government intends to pursue a clear and precise political project, which aims to modernize the country, improving its material and immaterial infrastructure, making the energy and digital transition and strengthening social inclusion, all in the name of sustainable development: it will be our northern star.\\n',\n",

about women and if it is we should all be concerned i was just saying that the convention has an approach that looks at everyone men and women even if in the wellknown statistical evidence that women are affected more and disproportionately i was just saying that the convention has an approach that looks at everyone men and women although in the known statistical evidence that women are affected more and disproportionately the convention and its international standards are also the result of comparative studies of national laws and practices on violence and harassment at work in as many as 80 countries the convention and its international standards are also the result of comparative studies of national laws and practices on violence and harassment at work in as many as 80 countries it is important to remember that the convention is an international treaty with binding force of course in the countries that decide to ratify it it is important to remember that the convention is an international treaty with binding force of course in the countries that decide to ratify it i recall that two are sufficient to begin with recommendation 206 in the context of the convention is obviously not binding but it is important in that it contains guidelines on how to apply the obligations of the convention206 in the context of the convention is obviously not binding but it is important insofar as it contains guidelines on how to apply the obligations of the convention another consideration the convention calls for violence and harassment in the workplace but it also involves and seeks to address a complex array of issues as has already been mentioned i am referring to mobbing stalking psychological violence the issue of worker protection and how to prevent and deal with violence and harassment there is also a further step a broad interpretation is meant precisely because it looks at a set of behaviours practices and acts intended to cause or even threaten physical psychological and economic harm or which is intended to be a sexual offence or genderbased violence there is also a further step it is a broad interpretation precisely because it looks at a set of behaviours practices and acts intended to cause or even threaten physical psychological and economic harm or which are  it is envisaged  configured as a sexual offence or as genderbased violence another forwardlooking element of the convention is that it is addressed to all types of workers ie not only to employees and not only to workplaces  i want to emphasize this  but also to those that i allow myself to define as not only places which are nevertheless only connected to the world of work ie for example work trips job training courses away from the usual workplace but also the means of communication and information chats emails and whatsapp that is all those offensive messages which we know can be used in an invasive way such as text messages images and even threatening messages as well as text messages and messages which can be used in an aggressive way as we well know as text messages and even threatening messages another forwardlooking element of the convention is that it is addressed to all types of workers that is to say not only to employees and not only to workplaces  i would like to emphasize this  but also to those which i may call nonplaces but which are nevertheless linked to the world of work ie for example business trips vocational training courses away from the usual place of work but also to the means of communication and information such as chats text messages emails whatsapp messages ie all those tools which as we know can be used in an invasive pervasive and i would even say distorting way becoming aggressive offensive and threatening through the transmission of video images or text this is why the convention makes an effort to include them before concluding i want to go back to the statistical evidence from which i started referring to the only survey we have practically however dated before concluding i would like to return to the statistical evidence from which i started referring to the only survey we have practically however dated i am referring to the 2016 istat survey on the safety of citizens which also addresses the chapter on violence and harassment at work and sexual blackmail one of the statistics provided by istat is that 1404 million women have experienced physical harassment and sexual harassment at work in their lifetime or 89 percent of the female workforce the survey also found that over 425000 women or 27 percent experienced these episodes in the threeyear period 20132016 it is clear that the figures are quite different when we talk about violence outside the workplace those i mentioned are confined to the workplace it is clear that the figures are quite different when we talk about violence outside the workplace those i mentioned are confined to the workplace cases involve physical contact requests for sexual services or availability in exchange for a promotion or job or promotion promotion or threat of dismissal the institute notes that in over 80 of cases victims do not report or tell anyone what happened to them only 07 of victims do the same institute notes that in more than 80 per cent of cases victims do not report or tell anyone what happened to them only 07 per cent of victims do of course all the victims interviewed by the istat stress that these incidents have changed their lives both personally and professionally because many of them have been fired or have resigned or have not been hired or have been dismissed surely however all the victims interviewed by the istat point out that these incidents have changed their lives both personal and professional because many of them have been fired or have resigned or have not been hired or have been dismissed the fratelli ditalia group both here in the senate and in the chamber will

again an increase in incidence which in the country is now equal to 16602 per 100000 inhabitants in a week as the monitoring booth report shows the countrywide incidence is therefore still far from levels that would allow case identification and contact tracing to be fully restored throughout the country as noted in the monitoring cabin report the incidence across the territory is therefore still far from levels that would allow the full restoration of case identification and contact tracing across the national territory with a weekly incidence value of 166 we are at a figure 3 times

highest form of democracy and equality without any difference in age gender territory health status and income this is the ideal that is shaped by the national health service which you have said many times that you want to defend and rightly so but too much inequality and too much falsehood still circulates lets think about science you said it right that science is our beacon how many falsehoods are still going around about vaccines that would not be safe because the very short time available to get a vaccine would have jumped the stepsthis is not true because the phases have been carried out simultaneously by researchers from all over the world in the commission we are carrying out a very important investigation consulting the leading italian experts who reassure us on this point mr minister we must implement transparent institutional and policy information and ensure continuous updating to take our citizens by the hand as far as traceability is concerned i do not know how many times i have said that we have tabled amendments because there is no national plan on tampons as mr de falco said very well before it is the cost and accessibility of tampons that are the biggest differences between territories and regions you mr minister have called for unity which must be practiced through dialogue also in parliament and this is where we must start if we really want to defend health as for schools there is an important proposal tuscany has taken a number of measures from transport to tutors who go to bus stops and help children keep their distance the project is called ti accompagno we ask minister azzolina to take this initiative as a national experiment what do we needwe cannot after a year be at the same level as last march we have to get out of this lockdown vaccines will protect us but we have to defend vaccines how do we defend themwith rules which we always ask our citizens to respect and for example with a protocol for workers mr minister let us not always be overwhelmed by problems without anticipating and addressing them in the newspapers we read about the issue of dismissals of workers who do not want to be vaccinated mr minister call the social partners together and we renew the protocol of 24 april last on work environments which has allowed infections not to be so widespread in the workplace and we discuss the specifics of different jobs together with the social partners vaccinations for the elderly should be done in the places closest to them therefore we do not think that the elderly can be called by the asl to go to who knows where to get vaccinated we immediately involve general practitioners speaking of proximity you appropriately set up a commission chaired by monsignor paglia on the question of the review of rsa we must move quickly on this aspect too moving beyond the rsa model and promoting homebased integrated medicine especially for the elderly i always hope that the parliament can also talk about esm resources because this is the issue that needs to be addressed i repeat we are making a big plan for home care for the elderly moreover it is not possible that in a pandemic situation there are still precarious people in the agenas among doctors healthcare staff and social workers we see this pandemic as a tremendous opportunity to have zero precariousness in health and social services i personally proposed the establishment of a national health guard as we need to prepare for any other pandemics we therefore need flexibility and not just building facilities and intensive therapies and ongoing training of health personnel and also volunteers who are periodically trained to respond to emergencies health in fact must cease to be culturally relevant to the sick but must be protected and defended by those who are healthy we must therefore focus on primary and secondary prevention home care digitization and local medicine in the health committee we recently unanimously approved a resolution that talks about resuming care for noncovid patients for example oncological and cardiopathic because it is absurd that they are neglected with these figures mr minister and with the data you have brought with you regarding the fact that hospitals are filling up we cannot afford to abandon more patients therefore we must absolutely act in this direction mr minister colleagues we must recover the beauty of everyday life because our lives are turned upside down for those who believe the pope on sunday made a beautiful speech on the meaning of the baptism of jesus jesus came among us to be close to us and to take up our daily lives she called for unity and i appeal to her to take up the daily life the beauty of the daily life of our fellow citizens we must first set an

vaccinate as many people as possible we need to strengthen the team those who based on their professional skills can help must be recruited mr minister we have also heard about your new agreement with general practitioners very good because they are our first interlocutors so if they too have the opportunity to be vaccinated and to vaccinate let us add additional forces and i also think of military healthcare as the red cross welcome anyone who can help because time is of the essence and why is itand why is that weve heard about the virus mutations that are coming and fortunately today pfizer said that the vaccine also covers the british and south african variants weve heard about the virus mutations that are coming and fortunately today pfizer said that the vaccine also covers the british

that of our president of the republic when he said that we must be builders and represent the country fortunately  i must say  there are them the great sages first of all mr zaffini said that in europe we did everything wrong i say that it is not at all so as the scientists we have heard from in the commission have also acknowledged to the specific question about what we did wrong they said what could people do who didnt know which way to go so it was done very well obviously corrections needed to be made but we didnt know what to expect so it was done very well obviously we need to make corrections but we didnt know what to expect so i have to say that both in terms of the vaccination campaign that we are facing and also in terms of what has been done before in the emergency we have all tried other european countries are no better off than we are as we know we are now among the first regions in europe to vaccinate so we can also address this emergency as we know we are now among the first regions in europe to vaccinate so we can also address this emergency as i said a moment ago we are all aware that compared to the needs of the economy and trade peoples health comes first and only by limiting the causes of the epidemic will we be able to promote economic recovery which we really need as i said before we are all aware that in relation to the needs of the economy and trade peoples health comes first and only by limiting the causes of the epidemic we will be able to promote economic recovery and we really need it in all this the fastest possible administration of the vaccine can allow us to return to normalcy in a short time so it is right to immunize all health workers  as has been said they are those who face the virus in the front row  as well as the weaker categories arriving  as the national vaccine plan says very well  to vaccinate other categories planning to anticipate the vaccination for teachers to promote the reopening of schools which senator i spoke very well about earlier as many other colleagues have done in all this the fastest possible administration of the vaccine can allow us to return to normalcy in a short time so it is right to immunize all health workers  as has been said they are the ones facing the virus in the front row  as well as the weaker categories arriving  as the national vaccine plan says very well  to vaccinate other categories as well anticipating the vaccination for teachers to promote the reopening of schools which senator iori has spoken very well before as many other colleagues have done if it is true in fact that we need to get people out of hospitals and lighten our healthcare facilities we believe that school is another fundamental and important factor while it is true that we need to get people out of hospitals and lighten our healthcare facilities we believe that school is another fundamental and important factor it is really about the health of our young people including the mental discomfort they are experiencing right now it is therefore a question of finding an adaptive strategy for pandemic planning and vaccination professor brusaferro said that it will be necessary to assess situations and vaccinate in case of outbreaks i am also thinking of other sectors starting with transport which must not only be reorganised we must also think of transport operators as well as the prison staff themselves who are helping us at this time i am also thinking of other sectors starting with transport which must not only be reorganised we must also think of transport operators as well as the prison staff themselves who are helping us at this time it is therefore  i repeat  a question of adapting in a flexible way what is a plan that we all know and which is very important to follow mr minister i would add that citizens are now very very tested and i am also thinking of their mental health which i have just mentioned when i speak of young people it is also important to address this aspect which is not insignificant because the psychological health of individuals is the psychological health of society as a whole which is essential for maintaining it as i feel and as i think we all see people are starting to feel some resentment about what is happening it is therefore essential that attention is also paid to psychological health an important aspect which i therefore ask you to take into account i think the prospects for another coming vaccine in addition to the two weve already had are superencouraging signals i think the prospects of another vaccine coming in addition to the two we already have are superencouraging signals we have seen that europe has been good and united in this we have all acted together for the acquisition of vaccines and i am convinced that we must also learn from these signals we have seen that europe has been good and united in this we have all acted together for the acquisition of vaccines and i am convinced that we must also learn from these signals we need to be patient and have confidence a lot of confidence even and above all in science and investing especially in research this is another message that this pandemic is giving us let us see what we have achieved in a short time thanks to the innovative technology of the vaccines that have been studied mr minister we once again give you confidence by

result has made it possible to resolve the phenomenon of italian sounding and counterfeiting of some of our excellent agrifood products as for the geographical indications for which coexistence with trademarks already registered in canada was envisaged in particular parmigiano reggiano three italian hams and three our cheeses this solution chosen to protect the rights acquired by local operators has nevertheless allowed the protection of some european products previously considered generic names as well as allowing the marketing of some products in particular parma ham as regards the geographical indications for which coexistence with trademarks already registered in canada was envisaged in particular parmigiano reggiano three italian hams and three our cheeses this solution chosen to protect the rights acquired by local operators nevertheless allowed the protection of certain european products previously considered generic names as well as allowing the marketing of certain products in particular parma ham the latter in fact before ceta could not be entered on the canadian market with its name but only as original ham given the existence of a trademark parma registered forty years earlier the latter before ceta could not be placed on the canadian market with its name but only as original ham given the existence of a trademark parma registered forty years earlier in addition the agreement contains specific provisions against italian sounding such as the prohibition of evocation for nonoriginating products ie the prohibition of the use of symbols photos colours and the like which may evoke the origin of the geographical indication the obligation to indicate the origin on the label in a clear and visible manner the obligation to further differentiate for products introduced on the market after a certain date which must bear the indication of useimitation style and so on as well as the possibility of administrative recourse by the proprietors of individual intellectual property rights of geographical indications furthermore the agreement contains specific provisions against italian sounding such as the prohibition of evocation for

possibility of administrative recourse by holders of intellectual property rights in individual geographical indications in the light of the foregoing therefore and with reference to the further point made by the applicant concerning the timing of imports into the european union of products bearing the designation parmesan originating in canada it is clear that european legislation expressly prohibits their marketing since the term parmesan is not generic but is an evocation of the designation parmigiano reggiano and as such cannot be used in the european union for cheeses which do not comply with the specifications of the italian pdo import cases which infringe the exclusive right in the union of the pdo parmigiano reggiano and its synonyms may be reported to the competent authorities of the member states  in the case of italy it is the central authority for the protection of food quality and the suppression of agricultural fraud rficq and the ministry of agricultural

requirements i would point out that the provision of clear understandable and legible information on food for consumer protection  a matter harmonised at european level where eu regulation 11692011 ensures a high level of consumer protection regulating all aspects of labelling  is a matter of utmost importance and commitment for this ministry finally in relation to the issue of product protection on the italian market and compliance with consumer protection labelling requirements i would point out that the provision of clear understandable and legible information on consumer food  a matter harmonised at european level where eu regulation 11692011 ensures a high level of consumer protection regulating all aspects of labelling  is of the utmost importance and commitment for this ministry this is evidenced for example by the letter signed jointly last march by minister bellanova and minister of economic development stefano patuanelli sent to the european commissioners for health and agriculture in which italy requested that the obligation of origin on the label be extended to all foodstuffs starting with a quick choice on these products which have already been tested for years on raw materials such as processed milk pasta tomatoes rice caramelized rice this is evidenced for example by the letter signed jointly by minister bellanova and minister of economic development stefano patuanelli last march sent to the european commissioners for health and agriculture in which italy requested that the obligation of origin of the raw materials on the label be extended to all foods starting with a quick choice on products on which it has already experimented in recent years such as milk cheeses processed meats pasta rice tomato derivatives with this in mind the ministers have notified brussels of the extension until 31 december 2021 of the decree of 9 december 2016 on milk and cheeses and have then signed the ministerial decree of 1 april 2020 which also extends the mandatory provisions of indication of origin on the label of durum wheat for durum wheat germ paste rice and tomato derivatives until 31 december 2021 this is in the belief that in the farm fork to strategy the mandatory origin must be a central theme precisely because since that phrase translates from the mandatory field to ta the origin best explains this interpretation so that in the label the consumer has the perception of the origin or path of traceability this is in the belief that in the farm to fork strategy the compulsory origin must be a central theme precisely because since that phrase translates from the field to the table the compulsory origin best declines this need so that in the label the consumer has the perception of the entire traceability path as for the control activities with specific reference to the one set up by the central inspectorate for the protection of quality and fraud prevention of agrifood products icqrf the latter pays the utmost attention to the verification of the indication of origin reported on agrifood products this is also done through sample checks of traceability to ascertain its veracity to counter the phenomenon of italian sounding to protect made in italy and the most representative productions in this area with particular reference to those protected by specific legislation of the european union pdo and pgi

the main online trading platforms ebay amazon alibaba on webbased trade strengthening the protection of consumers using these ecommerce platforms as well as the promotion promotion and information on

been signed with the main online trading platforms ebay amazon alibaba on web commerce strengthening the protection of consumers using these ecommerce platforms as well as the promotion promotion and information on italian pdo and pgi products in order to counter the phenomena of usurpation of italian registered quality names on the online market in response to the questions raised by the questioner as to whether italys ratification of ceta  instead of representing an opportunity for our country  would on the contrary become a vehicle for facilitating the importation of agrifood products with lower safety standards than those in europe i reply by pointing out that all agrifood products coming from canada will have to comply with european sanitary and phytosanitary legislation including the rules governing access to genetically modified organisms and products similarly due to the precautionary principle  which is enshrined in article 191 of the treaty on the functioning of the european union tfeu and is binding and cannot be amended or repealed by any international agreement including ceta  and sanitary and phytosanitary legislation products treated with substances that are banned as harmful at present the use of glyphosate is still authorised in the european union or for which there is no scientific evidence of harm but a suspected risk to human health will not be able to enter the internal market of the european union therefore while the precautionary principle remains valid the european union will continue to apply its legislation on the prohibition of hormones in livestock as provided for in directive 9622ec as amended by directive 200374ec in addition the import of untreated meat from third countries using hormones in livestock for their internal market is only possible if the segregation of farms is ensured which also applies to the use of antibiotics banned in the european union as provided for in directive 9623ec in addition the import of untreated meat from third countries that use livestock hormones for their internal market is only possible if livestock segregation is ensured a principle which also applies to the use of antibiotics banned in the european union as provided for in directive 9623ec this principle was clearly reaffirmed in the declarations annexed to the european council procedure for the adoption of the decision authorising the signature of ceta on behalf of the union this principle has been clearly reaffirmed in the declarations annexed to the procedure of the european council for the adoption of the decision authorising the signature of ceta on behalf of the union finally while specifically addressing the issue of gmos it should be recalled that with the implementation of directive 2015412eu the

maize or other species to date no new applications for marketing authorisation have been submitted for the cultivation of new gmos whether for maize or other species the current legislative system therefore allows action on all new gmos for which a european cultivation authorisation is applied for while at the same time the sanctioning system is able to punish all possible cases of infringement of the rules in force therefore the current legislative system enables action to be taken on all new gmos for which a european cultivation authorisation is requested while at the same time the sanctioning system is able to punish all possible cases of infringement of the rules in force as regards the legislation on labelling systems for food and feed containing genetically modified

unsatisfactory the questions put i would like to point out that i personally would have expected the presence of minister franceschini that is the minister who has a delegation for tourism or the

economic and health emergencies that the country has ever experienced  it is said  since the end of world war ii and we are facing a situation where we have all tourism stuck with a dry loss that will mean that it will be years before the sector can be restarted what we are experiencing is one of the most dramatic economic and health emergencies that the country has ever experienced  it is said  since the end of the second world war and we are facing a situation in which we have all tourism blocked with a dry loss that will make it take years before the sector can be put back into motion however within the framework of this tourism that we could define as nonprofit a service tourism we have youth tourism that is the availability that allows a young person to broaden cultural horizons and also the social perspective through this movement activity that allows italian young people to have the experience of going abroad and those who come from abroad to come to italy it is obvious that in the lockdown just as we are all locked in  and the next decree of the president of the council of ministers represents a further limitation on what we might call individual freedoms  we are depriving our young people of school attendance of cultural experiences even of deepening those related to university life and internships and in this case also of that capacity to broaden horizons let us not forget however that in the sixties the youth hostels themselves  and this is not an indifferent element  changed from the original designation of moral institutions to that of welfare institutions because it seemed almost as if it were necessary to assist in some way from the economic and organizational point of view young people in their movements then to the current one of cultural institutions we are therefore once again considering the world of young people in the worst possible way that is not considering it clearly the answer and even the speech of my predecessor seems almost to look with greater interest at the guarantee of jobs but we know that this guarantee is hanging by a thread which we could call at the moment the famous thread of the integrated fund and which will be subject to the cut of 30 march when the ban on redundancies will be lifted it is clear that the answer and also the speech of the colleague who preceded me seem almost to look with greater interest at the guarantee of jobs but we know that this guarantee is hanging by a thread which we could call at the moment the famous thread of the integrated fund and which will in any case be subject to the cut of 30 march when the ban on dismissals will be lifted we are facing a political attitude capable of turning over to this sector the blindness of a country that does not consider tourism its real black gold the example of tourism as the black gold of the country is an example that was made by minister franceschini minister for two legislatures now we do not know what will happen in the next government maybe minister franceschini will become the head of government and maybe if so he will give tourism and culture a much greater importance than it has been until now but we know that this kind of black gold which is italian tourism has never been able to be taken into account as the countrys own wealth an economic wealth an enogastronomic wealth  and this certainly also concerns his skills  a cultural wealth that is tradition but also the ability to look ahead now we do not know what will happen in the next government perhaps minister franceschini will become the head of government and maybe if so he will give tourism and culture a much greater importance than he has until now but we know that this kind of black gold which is italian tourism has never been able to be properly considered as the countrys own wealth an economic wealth a wine and gastronomic wealth  and this certainly also concerns his skills  a cultural wealth that is made of tradition but also of the ability to look forward i think it is ridiculous today to ask this question about youth hotels when the colleague put his question as you know there was still no pandemic when i put mine we were in the phase of broadening the horizons in the perspective of returning to a potential normality while today we are sinking into a dramatic black hole from which we do not even know when and how we will be able to get out given the impossibility of moving from one municipality to another or from one region to another this means serious myopia of government from a cultural economic social and organizational point of view and it means blindness to the rights of the new generations other than the recovery plan as a right of the next generation this is really blindness this is really

that the programme on which i was going to ask parliament for confidence did not and could not be resolved in a mere list of heterogeneous proposals nor even less in a sterile summary of the positions taken by each of the political forces that would have supported the majority already then i was aware that an alliance between political formations from different histories traditions experiences and cultures which  in addition  had also been completely opposed sometimes even in a very harsh way in the most recent international scenario could only arise on the basis of two fundamental differences the european leadership not only extrinsically interdependent but also a convinced anchorage between the values of the italian people  a way of recovering the role of the protagonist even in the geopolitical and geopolitical context in the european union  and of making it possible to return to the role of the protagonist in the first place as the main protagonist and in the second place as a means of protecting the european identity in the context of the european union from the moment the programme was drawn up in which i myself participated together with the delegations of the majority political forces we all worked together to ensure that the perspective of a broad and courageous reform project was drawn up i said then that this political project would mark the beginning of a new  which we all hoped for and still hope for  reform season aimed at building a fairer and more inclusive society able to combine the primary objective of economic growth revitalisation and modernisation with the essential requirements of sustainability social and territorial cohesion in the context of the full development of the person at the beginning of 2020 the conditions for the implementation of that project were measured unfortunately with the hurricane of the pandemic it was and is a hurricane that has upset and is profoundly upsetting our society our lifestyle habits our collective destiny the pandemic has forced us to redefine our priorities to rethink our development model the very dynamics of our relations we are facing a challenge of epochal scope we are measuring ourselves with the need to define the reconstructive lines of a society that is marked anew seems to be a reraining in the past by primordial fears often known precisely for generations of the past as well as the risk of losing essential bonds between health life and wellbeing all of which are deeply fragile some of our deeprooted convictions have suddenly been called into question politics itself has been forced to confront almost daily perhaps as never before science and technology in the difficulty of providing effective and rapid responses to an overwhelming health emergency and a severe economic recession even our most established legal knowledge has been severely challenged the state of emergency has forced us to introduce first in the west with all the doubts perplexities and difficulties and of course soon afterwards in all the other countries restrictive measures of human rights making very delicate and laborious balances between constitutional principles and rights in these dramatic months even in the face of unprecedented complexity this majority has managed to demonstrate great responsibility achieving with some difficulty convergences of views and resolutions of action as was required especially in the most critical stages we have cultivated a constant and close dialogue with all the institutional levels of our system from the regional authorities to those of the municipalities in the awareness that only by practicing regularly in an unconventional way the principle of cooperation it would be possible to pursue the strategies that are considered to be effective in this area especially in the areas of health not only that the experience of the pandemic has strengthened in the political forces which have loyally supported the government the awareness of the value of dialogue and dialectical confrontation between even distant positions which is an inescapable premise to make the most correct choices to make those superior syntheses in the highest collective interest to take the fundamental decisions from which due to the gravity of the hour we could not escape everyone on the spot will express their opinions we are in the field of the opinable for my part i can say that the government has operated the delicate balances and constitutional interests involved from time to time with the utmost scruple and with the utmost care in the awareness of the immense consequences that would have occurred in the lives of individuals and for the future of our community if today to you who are in this chamber and to the citizens who follow us from home

was certain from the fall the other was not and they are the certainty that we have the vaccine and therefore the obligation to rush to vaccinate most italians the other was in the recovery plan which this group has helped to change profoundly and for which today we need a board of directors the projects must be defined and i allow myself to point out that it must be put in synergy with a recovery plan from the public debt to prevent the central subject of the recovery plan which is not me but my children from having a public debt on his shoulders which will probably be able to lock in

percent and the optimistic forecasts of the ministry of economy and finance which predict a growth of 6 percent are denied first of all by the bank of italy which for 2021 forecasts a growth halved compared to that of the executive so we have a negative record we are the worst economy in the world there is a second dramatic element which is the health crisis our nurses our doctors and our staff are amazing but italy is the country in the world that has the worst ratio of population to covid deaths we need to invest more in health do it better and do it now the third and final point which i want to mention among many others concerns our negative record in the education and school crisis it is never discussed in a strategic and complete way and when in march 2020 i tried together with my colleagues to propose to organize in time to start school again there was a unanimous chorus saying that it was not the time the fact is that italy is the country that sent its children to school the least of all others in europe i would have expected an ambitious list from you not headlines or a summary of open points but a big dream for the countrys future a vision or a horizon mr president of the council you were afraid to go up to the quirinal the day after you resigned not because you put the countrys destiny at the centre but because you chose an institutional backdrop which i hope is useful for you and for the government but which i fear is harmful to the institutions she asked for clarity transparency and frankness and as she sees it she is satisfied mr president do not misuse your intelligence which i respect for months we have been respectfully asking you in this house for a change in may minister bonafede who sits to your right was the subject of a motion of censure which we shared in july i stood up from this bench and asked that august be devoted solely to discussing the recovery plan but we were not followed or satisfied indeed in december when an indecent draft of the recovery plan arrived in the council of ministers and we said that it was not appropriate to talk about it a minister in his government said that renzi was like orban because he wanted to block the recovery plan in november we met twice at palazzo chigi and her hospitality was as extraordinary as ever we decided to have a political table within the month to close the open issues in december we wrote her a fourpage letter to which she never replied in january we sent the democratic party and the others in the coalition a list with the 30 main files for months we have been asking you to change and we are asking you for a change it is not true that we have been impatient or irresponsible perhaps we have been too patient he said that this is not the time for a crisis many people have said this including my friends at the bar the communication has passed this is not the time to open a crisis i respect you mr president but this is the time to look within ourselves really and thoroughly and decide you who know greek better than i do know that this is a kairòs an opportune moment because now or never you can have the discussion mr president its now or never because we have a new president of the united states of america today is the last night that donald trump will sleep in lincolns room from tomorrow a new page opens with joe biden with multilateralism with a man leading the united states who has a great passion for europe and for italy mr president its now or never because a few days ago while we were arguing and discussing macron and merkel struck a deal with the european institutions together with china and we who had been the first to sign among a thousand controversies the one belt one road project didnt even enter the game mr president it is now or never because brexit is now playing its part what a dream it would be to enable younger people to finally imagine a big investment in the universities and institutes that are currently struggling because of the lack of erasmus in the uk how nice it would be to turn our universities into a centre of attraction how nice it would be to discuss young people and the future and not just domestic problemsnow or never because this is the year of the g20 and cop26 now or never mr president because now we have to send the children back to school in this regard we made a small proposal not talk we suggested starting next week and giving the 476000 doses of pfizer vaccine to the 435 teachers in the middle and lower secondary schools it is now or never for the economy because if we continue with a logic of small and micro interventions which unfortunately has also involved partly the budget law we will not get out of the crisis we are 160 in debt our children are locked in their homes and will pay the bill for this crisis more than anyone else what next generation eu if we are not in a position to leave our children nothing but mountains of debtit is now or never for the esm mr president we are investing 2700 per head in health and germany 5100 will there be a link between these two things or notsaying no to the esm in june has cost the national community 564 million to date i am thinking of the whole amaldi plan the research plan that for example many researchers have asked to be able to finance i am thinking of all the investments we can make for local medicine but also for personalised medicine and for technological innovation either we do it now or itll never come back sorry if im being obnoxious but well be cursed by our children if we dont invest in schools and healthcare now let me tell you that these are political issues you may agree or disagree but this is what we have been discussing so far artificial intelligence not poverty eradication the lottery of receipts not the cities of the future the nimby logic not how to do green jobs green jobs the possibility of increasing employment who should buy the monte dei paschi of siena relying on the same consultants who twenty years ago already made enough of a mess not the third sector and the social economy all over the world  and anyone who travels the world even now or who works with international institutions anyway knows this  we are preparing for a huge rebound in tourism because after people have been kept at home for a year and a half when in six or three months  hopefully as soon as possible  vaccines will allow us to get back to normal there will be a crazy surge of investment in tourism we asked that the next generation eu could invest more who loses todaysomeone says conte

euros into the economy no rules should so even today he recognized that there was a problem with the governance of the best of all possible worlds the europeanist world it was not going well and it would have been surprising considering the hands we are in in the hands of von der leyen herself who as minister of labour of the federal republic of germany on 23 august 2011 joined the finnish request to mortgage the parthenon a request that did not go very well for finland we are in the hands of those who delayed a strong united european response by waiting for the pandemic to hit home this is an objective fact and von der leyen herself apologised for it im going to put the numbers back in writing according to the latest estimates of the bank of italy in 2020 the gdp decreased by 9 percent reaching the level of 1998 but in this leap backwards of twentytwo years i want to draw your attention to one point so even before the crisis the country was 15 years behind and even before the crisis it would have taken 20 years to get back to the level of gdp of 2007 in the wonderful europeanist world of rules between 1960 and 2011 public investment in this country grew by an average of 17 percent a year if this growth were to continue they would have to reach around 44 billion euros between 2012 and 2019 but in 2019 investments amounted to 28 billion euros yes you heard it right you have to go back to the year of aldo moros kidnapping to have such a low level of public investment in italy but since then gdp has doubled how can we think of meeting the infrastructure needs of an economy that has doubled in volume with a supply of infrastructure that might have been adequate fortythree years agodo we want to reflect together on these figures that concern not only the league voters but all votersthis absurd result these reckless cuts are not the children of nn but are the children of mm and for this reason it is particularly hateful to us to witness the reckless and sterile dialectical acrobatics of those who keep telling us that the good of the whole can be achieved by doing harm to the parties and thus think to express a liberal thought with the truancy of those who feel that they are the depositary of the truth  and also say they are among other things  being in reality only the bearer of an epochal failure from which everyone today distances themselves any plan to revive the countrys economy is bound to fail without abandoning or at least a deep rethinking of the rules that stopped the recovery in 2012 i know that there is an awareness of this in a part of the majority i would say in a very large part and it was right of senator pittella to ask president von der leyen on 16 september that the stability pact be not only suspended but also rewritten the question i ask myself and we all have to ask ourselves is what happened to this request as far as we know nothing has happened because the socalled europe has not changed and the rhetoric of reforms which the prime minister has reiterated is here to refute the rhetoric of change the reforms as the usual colleague has authoritatively reminded us are always those of august 2011 and are always those of draghis letter cuts and taxes so ladies and gentlemen of the majority the truth is that nobody in europe listens to you and this is important for the country ladies and gentlemen you can also sell your voters authority in europe which is in fact just complacency but here we are culturally equipped enough to understand that if there was authority mr pittellas question would already have had an answer because as a european  not a europeanist  i can tell you that in other european countries the debate on rules exists is far ahead and that is the train we are missing on the other hand ceding makes you fragile in europe as lies make you fragile at home but the root of the evil is always the same namely the misalignment of parliament from the country and the misalignment of representatives from representatives this political data is very serious but obviously does not disturb those who had as a program the abolition of representative democracy selling the easy illusion that from their own home sofa you could command the world with a click and does not disturb of course even those who have the certainty of being able to govern regardless of consent

important and valuable role to safeguard the minister like a teacher from the word magister or a doctor represents the identity of a community and the most important and precious role to be safeguarded let us stop using incomplete terms devoid of any connection with the etymological meaning of the words the minister has the fundamental function of leading the country out of the pandemic

fundamental function of leading the country out of the pandemic and therefore we must represent the dignity of these institutions if we want to offer citizens the credibility and national responsibility which in this vote today manifests itself i consider this step politically relevant because it means that when the common good of the country is at stake the need to safeguard social buffers and to guarantee businesses the liquidity necessary to overcome this phase the stubborn work aimed at accompanying italy out of the pandemic crisis rightly requires the overcoming of the fences and barriers between majority and opposition putting in place a necessary sharing when the fate of the country is at stake i consider this step politically relevant because it means that when the common good of the country is at stake the need to safeguard social buffers and to guarantee companies the liquidity necessary to overcome this phase the stubborn work aimed at accompanying italy out of the pandemic crisis rightly requires the overcoming of fences and barriers between majority and opposition putting in place a necessary sharing when the fate of the country is at stake this is what we are talking about and that is why we must restore credibility and dignity to politics this is done if first of all we recognize among ourselves the responsibility of the parliamentary assemblies and the credibility of the measures we are examining lets start to unravel the commonplace we need to recognize that we are not in an economic phase in which we can talk about ordinariness asking a government to go through a pandemic while overcoming structural economic social and inequality knots which we have been dragging for twenty years is not worthy of good politics asking a government to go through a pandemic while simultaneously overcoming structural economic social and inequality knots which we have been dragging for twenty years is not worthy of good politics with these resources we are taking italy out of the pandemic and we know that we must combine especially with the new restorations decree emergency management and a complete reading of the pandemic crisis which inevitably requires a new vision and responses to create economic growth to overcome inequalities and to build a new model of economic development with the new face of europe with these resources we are taking italy out of the pandemic and we know that we need to unite especially with the new food order emergency management and a complete reading of the pandemic crisis which inevitably requires a new vision and responses to create economic growth to overcome inequalities and to build a new model of economic development with the new face of europe this is a great challenge enormous that requires responsibility and i am proud that the democratic party stands on its side in this so difficult and so delicate passage this is a big huge challenge which requires responsibility and i am proud that the democratic party is on its side in this difficult and delicate transition it is our identity it is the natural roots of our political affiliation it is our identity it is the natural roots of our political affiliation we must not be afraid to take on this responsibility and we must not be afraid to ask to strive to broaden the dialogue to build common ground even with the opposition when the national interest and the fate of young people are at stake from whom we are asking a huge effort we must not be afraid to take on this responsibility and we must not be afraid to ask to strive to broaden the confrontation to build sharing even with the opposition when the national interest and the fate of young people are at stake to whom we are asking for a huge effort we are in fact adding debt and asking for limitations because the distancing which is required in terms of relationships between people affects and locks up the younger generations asking them for an additional sacrifice for example in renouncing a school in the presence but also in renouncing so many relationships which are an integral part of the growth and development of young generations we are in fact adding debt and demanding limitations because the distancing which is required in terms of relationships between people affects and locks up younger generations asking them for an additional sacrifice for example in giving up a school in attendance but also in giving up many relationships which are an integral part of the growth and development of younger generations i believe then that with great determination we must recognize the work we are doing and attach to the emergency measures a project to get out of this pandemic crisis i believe then that with great determination we must recognise the work we are doing and attach to the emergency measures a plan to get out of this pandemic crisis this is why in my view it is also important to intervene in the field of vat disbursements we believe that these measures are essential if we are not to leave the world of vat statements in loneliness and indifference having guaranteed the universality of support which was not there is something important and valuable which must go beyond an absurd debate on chairs responsibilities and evading responsibility which at the moment i do not think we are allowed having guaranteed the universality of support which was not there is something important and precious which must go beyond an absurd debate about chairs responsibilities and the flight from responsibility which at this moment i believe is not allowed italy is not allowed to escape responsibility even for the european challenges we face where our future and the future of the italian economy and society are at stake so president our vote of confidence today is not a bureaucratic vote but it is the authentic interpretation of our identity it is a stimulus for the government to overcome the mechanism of the ateco codes and to begin to interpret the supply chains as an adequate response to recognize the necessary support fundamental to get through this crisis to the companies that have lost turnover coming out of the monthonmonth comparison and from those ateco codes that are probably not able to interpret the entire economic chain so mr president our vote of confidence

president members of the government colleagues we are here again to deal with and to approve the budget diversion an extraordinary measure because the stage the country is in is extraordinary due to the ongoing pandemic which forces us to take extraordinary measures to limit the economic and social damage that is bringing our country to its knees this further diversion has become necessary because the evolution of the epidemic in the second wave of the virus that was predicted around the world but which we have not been able to avoid in its recrudescence and spread is affecting our economy even more dramatically than in the first months of last spring because it inflicts an already widely weakened body this further shift has become necessary because the evolution of the epidemic in the second wave of the virus that was predicted worldwide but which could not be avoided in its recrudescence and spread is affecting our economy even more dramatically than in the early months of last spring because it affects a body that is already widely weakened and although the measures that have been taken so far have avoided a total lockdown of the country as in the first wave of the pandemic to balance the need to minimize economic costs with that of facing the health emergency this fails to limit any more than a potentially devastating effect on the economic fabric with an explosive increase in poverty and inequality not only in the more remote and degraded areas of the country and even if the measures taken so far have avoided a total lockdown of the country as in the

that obviously come to us from the territory from all the citizens that we are constantly hearing about everything that is happening it has been a year now since for the first time the wuhan

hope and optimism but we keep our guard up the start of the vaccination campaign was a moment we all hoped for we followed the services related to the arrival of the first doses and therefore we are hopeful and optimistic but we keep our guard up we cant say we made it that its all over no its still a long way off no its still a long way off but theres one important thing we need to be quick to vaccinate as many people as possible we need to strengthen the team whoever based on their professional skills can help needs to be recruited but there is one important thing we need to be quick to vaccinate as many people as possible we need to strengthen the team those who based on their professional skills can help must be recruited mr minister we have also heard about your new agreement with general practitioners very good because they are our first interlocutors so if they too have the opportunity to be vaccinated and to vaccinate let us add additional forces and i also think of military healthcare as the red cross welcome anyone who can help because time is of the essence and why is itand why is that weve heard about the virus mutations that are coming and fortunately today pfizer said that the vaccine also covers the british and south african variants weve heard about the virus mutations that are coming and fortunately today pfizer said that the vaccine also covers the british

and economic problems are linked we have to pay attention to both we need to pay attention to both of them in this period the calls for proposals from the regions  my region launched them the other

the whole community the future lies in feeling like brothers and not in wanting to dominate said pope francis and the image of the holy father in an empty st peters square immediately comes to mind an image that goes hand in hand with that of our president of the republic when he said that we must be builders and represent the country fortunately  i must say  there are them the great sages the

that of our president of the republic when he said that we must be builders and represent the country fortunately  i must say  there are them the great sages first of all mr zaffini said that in europe we did everything wrong i say that it is not at all so as the scientists we have heard from in the commission have also acknowledged to the specific question about what we did wrong they said what could people do who didnt know which way to go so it was done very well obviously corrections needed to be made but we didnt know what to expect so it was done very well obviously we need to make corrections but we didnt know what to expect so i have to say that both in terms of the vaccination campaign that we are facing and also in terms of what has been done before in the emergency we have all tried other european countries are no better off than we are as we know we are now among the first regions in europe to vaccinate so we can also address this emergency as we know we are now among the first regions in europe to vaccinate so we can also address this emergency as i said a moment ago we are all aware that compared to the needs of the economy and trade peoples health comes first and only by limiting the causes of the epidemic will we be able to promote economic recovery which we really need as i said before we are all aware that in relation to the needs of the economy and trade peoples health comes first and only by limiting the causes of the epidemic we will be able to promote economic recovery and we really need it in all this the fastest possible administration of the vaccine can allow us to return to normalcy in a short time so it is right to immunize all health workers  as has been said they are those who face the virus in the front row  as well as the weaker categories arriving  as the national vaccine plan says very well  to vaccinate other categories planning to anticipate the vaccination for teachers to promote the reopening of schools which senator i spoke very well about earlier as many other colleagues have done in all this the fastest possible administration of the vaccine can allow us to return to normalcy in a short time so it is right to immunize all health workers  as has been said they are the ones facing the virus in the front row  as well as the weaker categories arriving  as the national vaccine plan says very well  to vaccinate other categories as well anticipating the vaccination for teachers to promote the reopening of schools which senator iori has spoken very well before as many other colleagues have done if it is true in fact that we need to get people out of hospitals and lighten our healthcare facilities we believe that school is another fundamental and important factor while it is true that we need to get people out of hospitals and lighten our healthcare facilities we believe that school is another fundamental and important factor it is really about the health of our young people including the mental discomfort they are experiencing right now it is therefore a question of finding an adaptive strategy for pandemic planning and vaccination professor brusaferro said that it will be necessary to assess situations and vaccinate in case of outbreaks i am also thinking of other sectors starting with transport which must not only be reorganised we must also think of transport operators as well as the prison staff themselves who are helping us at this time i am also thinking of other sectors starting with transport which must not only be reorganised we must also think of transport operators as well as the prison staff themselves who are helping us at this time it is therefore  i repeat  a question of adapting in a flexible way what is a plan that we all know and which is very important to follow mr minister i would add that citizens are now very very tested and i am also thinking of their mental health which i have just mentioned when i speak of young people it is also important to address this aspect which is not insignificant because the psychological health of individuals is the psychological health of society as a whole which is essential for maintaining it as i feel and as i think we all see people are starting to feel some resentment about what is happening it is therefore essential that attention is also paid to psychological health an important aspect which i therefore ask you to take into account i think the prospects for another coming vaccine in addition to the two weve already had are superencouraging signals i think the prospects of another vaccine coming in addition to the two we already have are superencouraging signals we have seen that europe has been good and united in this we have all acted together for the acquisition of vaccines and i am convinced that we must also learn from these signals we have seen that europe has been good and united in this we have all acted together for the acquisition of vaccines and i am convinced that we must also learn from these signals we need to be patient and have confidence a lot of confidence even and above all in science and investing especially in research this is another message that this pandemic is giving us let us see what we have achieved in a short time thanks to the innovative technology of the vaccines that have been studied mr minister we once again give you confidence by voting in favour of the motion for a resolution that we have tabled mr president we are voting in favour of the motion for a resolution which we have tabled i believe however that common sense and citizens responsibility for which i am grateful must continue to play a key role in this important game which is all about health'],\n",

only one word responsibility the 32 billion together with the 209 billion of the recovery fund have become these days commodities of exchange traded with those whom today you call the builders the managers and who until yesterday for you were the bulldozers the 32 billion together with the 209 billion of the recovery fund have become these days commodities of exchange traded with those who today you call the builders the responsible and who until yesterday for you were the voltagabbana the way in which you have spent the resources of the italians has proved to be flawed it has failed all these months and we do not want to go any further not least because mr president the problem is not the 32 billion but the refreshments which are insufficient crumbs as the government knows for all the activities which you have closed by decree in this last year your way of spending the resources of the italians has proved to be flawed it has failed in all these months and we do not want to continue and go further also because mr president the problem is not the 32 billion but the refreshments which are insufficient crumbs as the government knows well for all the activities that you have closed by decree in this last year today we have minister gualtieri in the hearing that we held in the committee on budgets he confirmed that a change of pace is needed also with regard to these sums to be reimbursed to the italian taxpayers however we told him that the time has now expired because after this further diversion he has clearly told us that there will be no more i would also like to emphasize the fundamental inconsistency that you have because while today you are asking us to authorize a further diversion of 32 billion in two weeks that is no later than 31 january the revenue agency will start again with over 30 million tax returns so with one hand you give and with the other you take and remove these crumbs that we are giving to the italian taxpayers today we are not like some distinguished colleagues who told us in this chamber that the state should encourage the closure of many businesses we think instead that every business deserves to live by its own rules especially if it was your bad decisions that brought these businesses down we on the other hand believe that every enterprise deserves to live by its own rules especially if it was your own misguided decisions that brought these enterprises down you have been looking for responsible people everywhere in gyms restaurants bars cinemas on the ski slopes and yet given the numbers our nation unfortunately has the highest number of deaths and infections you have looked for managers and greasers everywhere in gyms restaurants bars cinemas on the ski slopes and yet given at hand our nation unfortunately has the highest number of deaths and infections then we in the brothers of italy say that businesses must be helped however these deviations will not be so effective because as we have always said it is not by giving bonuses handcuffs prebends and then a few thousand euros in loans at a loss that you will make live so many activities that in this last year you have reduced to the extreme so we in the fratelli ditalia say that companies must be helped however these changes will not be so effective because as we have always said it is not by giving bonuses handcuffs prebends and therefore a few thousand euros in nonrepayable loans that you will keep alive the many activities that in this last year you have reduced to the extreme our leader giorgia meloni said in a thousand ways that we had to change course path and attitude but you clearly have always been deaf to our proposals which i would like to recall our leader giorgia meloni said in a thousand ways that we had to change course path and attitude but you clearly have always been deaf to our proposals that i would like to remind we have said that catering should not be allocated according to ateco codes but according to the decrease in turnover because it has been shown that catering accounts for 7 percent of the fixed costs of enterprises for us fratelli ditalia therefore you have failed as a government you must take note of this and not continue to be attached to your chairs because the real responsible are we fratelli ditalia who for months inside and outside this parliament have been making proposals that this government has never wanted to listen to you must take note of this and not continue to be attached to your chairs because the real culprits are we the brothers of italy who for months inside and outside this parliament have been making proposals that this government has never wanted to listen to that is why we do not want to be responsible i have used this word several times

by the viva italia group  psi on one point mr presidentinoffice you are absolutely right governing the unknown in a tragedy that has claimed thousands of lives is a burden that no one in italy has ever borne since 1944 they want the pandemic to be tackled decisively schools to reopen the foundations for economic recovery to be laid a fairer freer italy in a world where politics prevails over multinationals and high finance precisely because their behaviour has been exemplary italians demand that we deal first with them and then perhaps with us and they want above all the certainty that this path takes place thanks to the stability and certainty of a binomial that is at the top of our state order and that naturally concerns the presidency of the republic and the presidency of the council of ministers with its government it is obvious it is known and it has been written since that day today we do not need 161 votes for confidence just read the italian constitution it is true it is certainly true that from 1944 to today there have been about ten governments that did not originally enjoy an absolute majority these are the cases of executives born without a majority in the italian parliamentary experience we know well that italy is living in a state of emergency but you have in your hands two extraordinary opportunities already mentioned by senator monti afflicted by the fear of a third epidemic wave gripped by a fierce economic crisis the decisive year in which the negative turn of history can be reversed is exactly this and it is 2021 for two reasons the first was certain from the fall the other was not and they are the certainty that we have the vaccine and therefore the obligation to rush to vaccinate most italians the other was in the recovery plan which this group has helped to change profoundly and for which today we need a board of directors the projects must be defined and i allow myself to point out that it must be put in synergy with a recovery plan from the public debt to prevent the central subject of the recovery plan which is not me but my children from having a public debt on his shoulders which will probably be able to lock in particularly many of his efforts it would be a mistake to face this challenge without a longterm political project let us imagine if you govern with one less vote mr president then i ask you how the ideas you presented yesterday in the chamber and today in the senate are turned into projects i appreciate that a truth has finally been shared a government with a majority built on a miracle fishery was useless even harmful i too had  i rarely get that believe me  a very hot phone and maybe it was agostino depretis who called me misquoted by the person who should read the story he reformed the secular and compulsory school up to the age of ten to those who asked me i replied that i didnt look like a barbers chair you understood today however you set a strategy in two steps a vote of confidence and then a majority i share its preamble a determined opposition to any form of nationalism  it is the evil of europe  because we have also touched here with our own hands the bad reasons of those who keep europe in their sights and consider our western position an accident to be contended with incessant dialogues with putins russia but that is the wrong way the hunt for the different a ferocious language and terrapallism have eroded spaces of freedom and individual rights here too and this risk can never be run again if we need to work to never run it again  i quote nenni and it will be the only quote i make  out of rancor to achieve a space of unity this is the way that must be followed you clearly addressed leu the democratic party the 5 star movement and appealed to willing political forces who recall the popular liberal and socialist tradition these are the three families that lead most european countries one of these was matteo renzi then leader of the democratic party who led the party of european socialism six years ago one of these sits authoritatively among the benches of his government i do not know whether the democratic party shares your intention or not at least i did not see any sign either positive or negative in yesterdays debate in montecitorio mr president i do know that the socialists will assess your proposal in time given that in recent months we have supported your government as stateless people we are not part of it we have never received an invitation to take part in meetings in which important decisions were being prepared when we disagreed we did not resort to small claims but we expressed our disagreement here in the light of the sun loyally and even twice with two opposing votes on specific issues in

              "  'mr president mr minister honourable colleagues the virus continues to spread rapidly the emergence of new variants with greater dissemination capacity even if with unchanged pathogenic action has simply accelerated this process we see this simply by observing what happens in other european countries which in fact alternate measures and phases that are less restrictive with others that push up to total lockdown our country which also experiences the difficulties of regionalization of the national health system as a result of the rules of title v of the constitution in the path of the fight against coronavirus despite the enormous difficulties involved has always tried to maintain the right balance between restrictions and concessions between openings and closings despite the large problems and repercussions that each measure brought with it we must never forget however a fundamental point that so many citizens demand the protection of health comes first the protection of the integrity and life of everyone goes beyond what may be the demands even just and justified of some no one has ever forgotten in the various measures adopted the economic social and complex problematic consequences for so many citizens that they would cause but always trying to give concrete answers the political will has always been to protect the most disadvantaged economic groups and the most fragile and vulnerable people in our social state unfortunately a greater elasticity and a reduction in the most restrictive measures is almost a logical consequence of a rapid increase in infections an acceleration in the spread of the virus and its surge with the rise of the rt index increasingly it is necessary to insist on the continuous awareness and information of citizens in recalling their sense of citizenship and belonging to the community if we do not all succeed in this process of maturation and inner processing we will not be able to eradicate or defeat the virus any measure even the most shared and participated requires the convinced adherence of every citizen its an adherence that for the most part has been and for which we can only thank the italians its important to remember that the rules apply and are fully realized only if each of us understands that in this pandemic everyone has to do their part every day not out of simple obligation or fear of sanctions but because our responsible behaviour is an indispensable condition in the difficult battle against the coronavirus those who govern must know how to sparkle and balance the measures with the right balances if the virus is so dynamic and changeable in its aggressiveness even the consequential policy choices cannot be static but must be balanced and modified in relation to the trend of the pandemic i would like to highlight two aspects in particular in the architecture of the dpcm that we are analysing the first relates to the introduction in the context of the subdivision of the different zones according to the infectivity index recorded of the socalled white area which provides for less restrictive measures than the socalled yellow area always in order to ensure the maximum consistency between the epidemiological scenario applicable to each territory and the degree of rigor of the containment measures applied this innovation agreed with the technicalscientific committee represents and encompasses at this particular moment more than anything else a symbolic value and a message of encouragement to italians be more virtuous and attentive you can and you must the second aspect concerns the lowering of the threshold value of rt infection rates to enter or pass through the various areas certainly a fundamental support in the management of this pandemic has begun with the administration of vaccines whose progressive availability will allow us to have a lethal weapon against the virus starting with those in the front line such as health workers and the weakest and most fragile members of the population the tens of thousands of deaths the suffering of intensive care the gaze lost in the void of those who know that they may not make it are a warning to institutions and citizens to try to do more and better in the interest of the community the many required sacrifices to which so many have adhered with awareness and conscience cannot be undone when despite the many doubts and uncertainties at the moment when the vaccination campaign has just begun we finally step into the light at the bottom of a tunnel',\n",

inhabitants between december 14 and 27 to 31328 cases in the period from december 21 to january 3 although the week under assessment was characterised by a lower number of tampons on public holidays there is again an increase in incidence which in the country now stands at 16602 per 100 although the week under assessment was characterized by a lower number of tampons on public holidays there is again an increase in incidence which in the country is now equal to 16602 per 100000 inhabitants in a week as the monitoring booth report shows the countrywide incidence is therefore still far from levels that would allow case identification and contact tracing to be fully restored throughout the country as noted in the monitoring cabin report the incidence across the territory is therefore still far from levels that would allow the full restoration of case identification and contact tracing across the national territory with a weekly incidence value of 166 we are at a figure 3 times higher than the ceiling of 50 new cases considered the maximum threshold that can be managed by the territorial health services with a weekly incidence value of 166 we are 3 times higher than the

intensive care and medical care above the critical threshold in particular as regards the occupancy rate in intensive care it should be noted that at national level it is once again above the critical

clarity to ensure that assessments are based on the evidence transparency and intelligibility of the data themselves i believe that in recent weeks the restrictive measures have achieved the objective of limiting the spread of the infection but we must not let our guard down the data which are still somewhat negative in recent days especially in some regions confirm that the choices made for the

              "  'boldrini pd  it mr president ladies and gentlemen we believe that the question referred for a preliminary ruling is based on profoundly erroneous and pretentious considerations i remember however that minister speranza also came last week on 13 january to explain the whole dpcm in our view therefore the government has always acted and continues to act in compliance with the fundamental principles of the ordering and hierarchy of the sources of law on the extension of the state of emergency in fact the decreelaw in conversion limits itself correctly to adapting the framework of the primary sources which already regulate the measures to cope with the epidemiological emergency to the specific needs that led to this extension we all know the needs that led to this extension with the epidemic still ongoing not only from us but also in other countries i do not necessarily want to use the example of other countries but it should be remembered that many other countries have resorted to a complete lockdown which we are trying to avoid as much as possible in addition the government through minister esperanza has previously explained to parliament the reasons why it has become necessary to extend the state of emergency in compliance with the provisions of article 2 paragraph 1 of decreelaw 25 march 2020 n19 according to which the president of the council of ministers or a minister delegated by him explains in advance to the houses the content of the measures to be taken  in order to take account of any guidelines drawn up by the commission  i would therefore remind you that on that occasion we tabled a majority resolution which contained indications which we saw later in the dpcm including that of favouring the full resumption of teaching activities in attendance you have seen that in fact schools are gradually resuming and of preparing in agreement with the regions and the autonomous provinces an adequate transport plan you can see how many meetings are being held together with the regions the stateregions conference and the minister for regional affairs and autonomy on this matter we must also pay attention because some of the things that need to be done  we must remember this  are also the responsibility of other bodies in addition this resolution has also served to include in the decreelaw that we will have to convert an initiative aimed at ensuring the fastest implementation of the strategic plan for vaccines you have indeed seen how the issue of vaccines continues to be important and urgent returning to what is said in the question the extension of the state of emergency establishes the deadline of 30 april given the worrying trend of the epidemiological emergency from covid and in compliance with the provisions of the civil protection code i remind colleagues that as far as the civil protection code is concerned the same code was used in the event of earthquakes just to be able to continue to extend the state of emergency if not all the necessary activities have been done to keep people safe similarly the state of emergency was extended making use of the legislative decree of 2 january 2018 n1 to confirm that the state of emergency is not a rule in fact it was extended until 30 april not always as you claim in the preliminary question this fact has been overcome therefore the primary regulatory framework has been respected and no constitutional censorship can be imposed on the work of the government the decreelaw is not a special law nor an edict as is the decreelaw of 14 january 2021 n2 which we are translating into law which finds its legitimacy in a source of primary rank there is really no reason to call the measures adopted so far in full respect of the role of parliament illegitimate in fact minister speranza has come again and again to tell us what the epidemiological situation is and what measures they should have taken of course always in full harmony with what science says some changes have been made of course but also because the epidemiological evolution has affected so much in this period no one knew how things would go and we obviously have to adjust the shot every time we are faced with an emergency by the way colleagues i remind you that not all of our citizens are complaining i have spoken to many people who told me that if we have to make another effort we are doing it precisely because we want to be freer later without the virus so we believe that given the emergency we must continue to apply the highest level of caution first of all ourselves who must set an example not like those who went to dinner in restaurants to join the ioapro protest overall we need to mitigate the risk of an uncontrolled outbreak and the increased pressure on health facilities i remind you that even now unfortunately the numbers weigh on health facilities health professionals are asking us to be careful because they cant take it anymore so out of respect for them we need to move forward with these measures we believe that as a consequence an extension of the current state of emergency is necessary as provided for in the decree of the president of the council of ministers in order to allow the adoption and implementation of measures to contain the spread of the virus we are doing what needs to be done for our citizens and i believe that for the last time we must do it with this dpcm are we sure that we will be able to get out of this situation perfectlyi very much hope so but we must do so with all the necessary tools the group of the democratic party therefore rejects the question referred for a preliminary ruling on the constitutionality of bill no 2066'],\n",

              "  'an institutional crisis has not yet been opened because you have not resigned from the quirinal but there are three big enormous and dramatic crises which have been open for a long time and certainly not because of you mr president the first is the economic one italy is the worstplaced country from the point of view of the fall in gdp in the year 2020 with a decrease of 10 percent and the optimistic forecasts of the ministry of economy and finance which predict a growth of 6 percent are denied first of all by the bank of italy which for 2021 forecasts a growth halved compared to that of the executive so we have a negative record we are the worst economy in the world there is a second dramatic element which is the health crisis our nurses our doctors and our staff are amazing but italy is the country in the world that has the worst ratio of population to covid deaths we need to invest more in health do it better and do it now the third and final point which i want to mention among many others concerns our negative record in the education and school crisis it is never discussed in a strategic and complete way and when in march 2020 i tried together with my colleagues to propose to organize in time to start school again there was a unanimous chorus saying that it was not the time the fact is that italy is the country that sent its children to school the least of all others in europe i would have expected an ambitious list from you not headlines or a summary of open points but a big dream for the countrys future a vision or a horizon mr president of the council you were afraid to go up to the quirinal the day after you resigned not because you put the countrys destiny at the centre but because you chose an institutional backdrop which i hope is useful for you and for the government but which i fear is harmful to the institutions she asked for clarity transparency and frankness and as she sees it she is satisfied mr president do not misuse your intelligence which i respect for months we have been respectfully asking you in this house for a change in may minister bonafede who sits to your right was the subject of a motion of censure which we shared in july i stood up from this bench and asked that august be devoted solely to discussing the recovery plan but we were not followed or satisfied indeed in december when an indecent draft of the recovery plan arrived in the council of ministers and we said that it was not appropriate to talk about it a minister in his government said that renzi was like orban because he wanted to block the recovery plan in november we met twice at palazzo chigi and her hospitality was as extraordinary as ever we decided to have a political table within the month to close the open issues in december we wrote her a fourpage letter to which she never replied in january we sent the democratic party and the others in the coalition a list with the 30 main files for months we have been asking you to change and we are asking you for a change it is not true that we have been impatient or irresponsible perhaps we have been too patient he said that this is not the time for a crisis many people have said this including my friends at the bar the communication has passed this is not the time to open a crisis i respect you mr president but this is the time to look within ourselves really and thoroughly and decide you who know greek better than i do know that this is a kairòs an opportune moment because now or never you can have the discussion mr president its now or never because we have a new president of the united states of america today is the last night that donald trump will sleep in lincolns room from tomorrow a new page opens with joe biden with multilateralism with a man leading the united states who has a great passion for europe and for italy mr president its now or never because a few days ago while we were arguing and discussing macron and merkel struck a deal with the european institutions together with china and we who had been the first to sign among a thousand controversies the one belt one road project didnt even enter the game mr president it is now or never because brexit is now playing its part what a dream it would be to enable younger people to finally imagine a big investment in the universities and institutes that are currently struggling because of the lack of erasmus in the uk how nice it would be to turn our universities into a centre of attraction how nice it would be to discuss young people and the future and not just domestic problemsnow or never because this is the year of the g20 and cop26 now or never mr president because now we have to send the children back to school in this regard we made a small proposal not talk we suggested starting next week and giving the 476000 doses of pfizer vaccine to the 435 teachers in the middle and lower secondary schools it is now or never for the economy because if we continue with a logic of small and micro interventions which unfortunately has also involved partly the budget law we will not get out of the crisis we are 160 in debt our children are locked in their homes and will pay the bill for this crisis more than anyone else what next generation eu if we are not in a position to leave our children nothing but mountains of debtit is now or never for the esm mr president we are investing 2700 per head in health and germany 5100 will there be a link between these two things or notsaying no to the esm in june has cost the national community 564 million to date

for personalised medicine and for technological innovation either we do it now or itll never come back sorry if im being obnoxious but well be cursed by our children if we dont invest in schools and healthcare now let me tell you that these are political issues you may agree or disagree but this is what we have been discussing so far artificial intelligence not poverty eradication the lottery of receipts not the cities of the future the nimby logic not how to do green jobs green jobs the possibility of increasing employment who should buy the monte dei paschi of siena relying on the same consultants who twenty years ago already made enough of a mess not the third sector and the social economy all over the world  and anyone who travels the world even now or who works with international institutions anyway knows this  we are preparing for a huge rebound in tourism because after people have been kept at home for a year and a half when in six or three months  hopefully as soon as possible  vaccines will allow us to get back to normal there will be a crazy surge of investment in tourism we asked that the next generation eu could invest more who loses todaysomeone says conte renzi or italia viva i think of that page of i malavoglia  which you certainly know better than me  where uncle crucifisso receives the news that in the battle someone from the country luca has died

it seems that the discussion is about individuals i have lost nothing we have lost nothing mr president but it is italy that is losing the worst thing to lose which is the greatest opportunity more

about women and if it is we should all be concerned i was just saying that the convention has an approach that looks at everyone men and women even if in the wellknown statistical evidence that women are affected more and disproportionately i was just saying that the convention has an approach that looks at everyone men and women although in the known statistical evidence that women are affected more and disproportionately the convention and its international standards are also the result of comparative studies of national laws and practices on violence and harassment at work in as many as 80 countries the convention and its international standards are also the result of comparative studies of national laws and practices on violence and harassment at work in as many as 80 countries it is important to remember that the convention is an international treaty with binding force of course in the countries that decide to ratify it it is important to remember that the convention is an international treaty with binding force of course in the countries that decide to ratify it i recall that two are sufficient to begin with recommendation 206 in the context of the convention is obviously not binding but it is important in that it contains guidelines on how to apply the obligations of the convention206 in the context of the convention is obviously not binding but it is important insofar as it contains guidelines on how to apply the obligations of the convention another consideration the convention calls for violence and harassment in the workplace but it also involves and seeks to address a complex array of issues as has already been mentioned i am referring to mobbing stalking psychological violence the issue of worker protection and how to prevent and deal with violence and harassment there is also a further step a broad interpretation is meant precisely because it looks at a set of behaviours practices and acts intended to cause or even threaten physical psychological and economic harm or which is intended to be a sexual offence or genderbased violence there is also a further step it is a broad interpretation precisely because it looks at a set of behaviours practices and acts intended to cause or even threaten physical psychological and economic harm or which are  it is envisaged  configured as a sexual offence or as genderbased violence another forwardlooking element of the convention is that it is addressed to all types of workers ie not only to employees and not only to workplaces  i want to emphasize this  but also to those that i allow myself to define as not only places which are nevertheless only connected to the world of work ie for example work trips job training courses away from the usual workplace but also the means of communication and information chats emails and whatsapp that is all those offensive messages which we know can be used in an invasive way such as text messages images and even threatening messages as well as text messages and messages which can be used in an aggressive way as we well know as text messages and even threatening messages another forwardlooking element of the convention is that it is addressed to all types of workers that is to say not only to employees and not only to workplaces  i would like to emphasize this  but also to those which i may call nonplaces but which are nevertheless linked to the world of work ie for example business trips vocational training courses away from the usual place of work but also to the means of communication and information such as chats text messages emails whatsapp messages ie all those tools which as we know can be used in an invasive pervasive and i would even say distorting way becoming aggressive offensive and threatening through the transmission of video images or text this is why the convention makes an effort to include them before concluding i want to go back to the statistical evidence from which i started referring to the only survey we have practically however dated before concluding i would like to return to the statistical evidence from which i started referring to the only survey we have practically however dated i am referring to the 2016 istat survey on the safety of citizens which also addresses the chapter on violence and harassment at work and sexual blackmail one of the statistics provided by istat is that 1404 million women have experienced physical harassment and sexual harassment at work in their lifetime or 89 percent of the female workforce the survey also found that over 425000 women or 27 percent experienced these episodes in the threeyear period 20132016 it is clear that the figures are quite different when we talk about violence outside the workplace those i mentioned are confined to the workplace it is clear that the figures are quite different when we talk about violence outside the workplace those i mentioned are confined to the workplace cases involve physical contact requests for sexual services or availability in exchange for a promotion or job or promotion promotion or threat of dismissal the institute notes that in over 80 of cases victims do not report or tell anyone what happened to them only 07 of victims do the same institute notes that in more than 80 per cent of cases victims do not report or tell anyone what happened to them only 07 per cent of victims do of course all the victims interviewed by the istat stress that these incidents have changed their lives both personally and professionally because many of them have been fired or have resigned or have not been hired or have been dismissed surely however all the victims interviewed by the istat point out that these incidents have changed their lives both personal and professional because many of them have been fired or have resigned or have not been hired or have been dismissed the fratelli ditalia group both here in the senate and in the chamber will
